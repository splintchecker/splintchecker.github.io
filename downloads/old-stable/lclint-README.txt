				 LCLint

LCLint is a tool for statically checking C programs.  With minimal
effort, LCLint can be used as a better lint.  If additional effort is
invested adding annotations to programs, LCLint can perform stronger
checking than can be done by any standard lint. 

For documentation on LCLint, please see http://lclint.cs.virginia.edu.
