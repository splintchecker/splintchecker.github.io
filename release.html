Splint Release 3.1.2
</h2>
<b>12 July 2007</b>
</center>
This release contains minor bug fixes, most of which were in the CVS
code previously, but had not been released in an updated source
distribution. See the <a href="changes.html">change log</a> for
details.

<center><h2>
Splint Release 3.1.0
</h2>
<b>21 April 2003</b>
</center>
This release  contains numerous enhancements.  Among other imporvements, the accuracy of the bounds checking code has improved; Splint can produce output in html or comma separated value(CSV) format; and support for numabstract types has been added.  Additionally the code  contains numerous bugs fixes and house keeping updates.  
See the <a href="changes.html">change log</a> for details.

<center><h2>
Splint Release 3.0.1.6
</h2>
<b>11 February 2002</b>
</center>
<p>
The main changes in this release are extensions to the grammar.  The grammar was extended to support ISO C99 and gcc obsolete extensions for initializing structure fields and array elements using explicit designators.  Additionally we relaxed the grammar to allow null statements as external declarations.  The release also fixes some internal bugs.  See the <a href="changes.html">change log</a> for details.

<center><h2>
Splint Release 3.0.1.5
</h2>
<b>5 February 2002</b>
</center>
<p>
Some changes have been made which affect the format of splint error messages for bounds errors.  Additionally the flag bounds-compact-error-messages has been added.  This release also fixes some bugs in Splint 3.0.1.4.  See the <a href="changes.html">change log</a> for details.

Splint Release 3.0.1
</h2>
<b>7 January 2002</b>
</center>
<p>

Splint 3.0.1 is the successor to LCLint 2.5q.  The main changes are
support for detection of security vulnerabilities (including buffer
overflows) and extensible checks and annotations.

Most security attacks exploit instances of well-known classes of
implementations flaws.  This article describes how Splint can be used to
detect common security vulnerabilities (including buffer overflows and
format string vulnerabilities).

<p>
Buffer overflow attacks may be today's single most important security
threat. This paper presents a new approach to mitigating buffer
overflow vulnerabilities by detecting likely vulnerabilities through
an analysis of the program source code. Our approach exploits
information provided in semantic comments and uses lightweight and
efficient static analyses. This paper describes an implementation of
our approach that extends the LCLint annotation-assisted static
checking tool. Our tool is as fast as a compiler and nearly as easy to
use. We present experience using our approach to detect buffer
overflow vulnerabilities in two security-sensitive programs.
