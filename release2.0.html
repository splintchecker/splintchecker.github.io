LCLint Version 2.0<BR>
</H2>
<em>29 February 1996</em>
<P>
Version 2.0 is a major upgrade to the last publically released version
of LCLint, Version 1.4c. 
<p>
The most important enhancement is detection of errors relating to
dynamic memory management:  <A HREF="guide/guide.html#sec-5">uses of
deallocated storage</A>, <A HREF="guide/guide.html#sec-5">memory leaks</A>,
<A HREF="guide/guide.html#sec-6">dangerous data sharing or unexpected aliasing</A>, 
<a href="guide/guide.html#sec-7.1">uses of possibly undefined storage</A>, 
<a href="guide/guide.html#sec-7.2">dereferencing a possibly null
pointer</A>.  These errors are detected using information provided in
<a href="guide/guide.html#sec-2.3.1">annotations</a>.  This is described
in

<p>
Other new features include:
<ul>
<li> Support for customizable <A HREF="guide/guide.html#sec-9">naming
conventions</A>. 
<li> <A href="guide/guide.html#sec-8.2.1">Side-effect free macro
parameters</a>.
<li> More flexible checking of <A href="guide/guide.html#sec-4.2.1">
global variables</a>. 
<li> Checking of <a href="guide/guide.html#sec-10.2">control structures<a/>.
<li> <a href="guide/guide.html#sec-2.1">Hints</a> providing more
information on a reported error and how the message can be suppressed
are optionally included. 
<li> Source code comments can now be used to express everything that can
be expressed in LCL specifications and is used in LCLint checking.
<li> LCLint now manages memory explicitly and requires no garbage
collector.  This was accompilshed using LCLint's static memory checking. 
</ul>

Many of these features were suggested by user comments.  Development is
largely driven by user feedback, so please continue to send me
suggestions, ideas, complaints and bug reports.  <a
href="acknowledgements.html">Thanks</a> to everyone who sent comments
and bug reports.  We are also interested in any more general feedback or
experience you have to report.
