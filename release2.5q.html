<h3>Enhancements</h3>

<b>Boolean Checking</b> 

<blockquote>
Fixed boolean type checking to treat user boolean types consistently.
Added the <tt>-zerobool</tt> mode flag to control whether or not <tt>0</tt>
may be treated as a boolean (the default in standard mode is to allow
<tt>0</tt> to represent boolean FALSE, as was the old behavior).
</blockquote>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>

<b>Special Clauses at function exit</b> 
<blockquote> LCLint reports an
internal error for violations of pre-clauses at function exits.  The
pre special clauses should not be checked at function exit points.  (Reported by Bernd Warken).
</blockquote>

<b>Passing incompatible long/int pointers</b>
<blockquote>
If +relaxquals is set (as in standard mode), LCLint does not report an
error when an int * is passed as a long int *, even though this is
dangerous.  (Reported by Peter van Hoof).
</blockquote>

<B>Mysterious Parse Errors</b>
<blockquote>
The parser appeared broken under certain compilers with optimizations
turned on and versions of bison.  This had to do with stray use of an
old sgrammar.h and sgrammar_tokens.h files.
</blockquote>

<b>Include Files</b>
<blockquote>
Search path for include files in nested directories does not handle
current directory correctly.  (Reported by Simon Dyke)
</blockquote>

<b>Unnamed Array Parameters</b>
<blockquote>
LCLint handles int[][2] in a parameter list differently from int p[][2]
(revealed through spurious incomplete type errors).  (Reported by Peter
van Hoof.)
</blockquote>

<b>Parsing malformed comments</b>
<blockquote>
LCLint crashes on malformed syntactic comments like
<tt>/*@-PRIVATE-CALLS-@*/</tt>.  (Reported by Wolfgang Stolzenburg.)
</blockquote>

<b>Printing long long</b>
<blockquote>
LCLint does not support %lld format codes in printf for <tt>long
long</tt>.  (Reported by Denis Baylor.)
</blockquote>

<b>Spurious stack-allocation errors</b>
<blockquote>
LCLint incorrectly assumes elements of stack-allocated arrays are
stack-allocated.  (Reported by Denis Baylor.)
</blockquote>

<b>Result Codes</b>
<blockquote>
LCLint does not return EXIT_FAILURE as it should when the error counts
do not match.  (Reported by Herbert Dietze.)
</blockquote>

<b>Hex Constants with UL</b>
<blockquote>
LCLint reports an error for hex constants ending with U and L modifiers.
(Reported by David Denholm.)
</blockquote>

<b>Dumping special ctypes</b>
<blockquote>
Internal error in cttable.i when creating a library file requires a
comparison between two special ctypes (e.g., "..." in function types).
(Reported by Martin Smoot.)
