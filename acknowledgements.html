Splint is developed and maintained
by the Secure Programming Group at the <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Department of
Computer Science</a>.  <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans">David Evans</a> is the project leader and the primary developer
of Splint. 

<p><a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/larochelle">David Larochelle</a> developed
the memory bounds checking.  University of Virginia students Chris Barker,
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~dkf5k">David Friedman</a>, Mike
Lanouette and Hien Phan all contributed significantly to 
the development of Splint.</p>

<p>Splint is the successor to
LCLint, a tool originally developed as a joint research project between the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Digital Equipment Corporation’s System
 Research Center.  <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans">David Evans</a> was the primary designed and developer of LCLint. 

<A HREF="http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/~guttag/">John Guttag</A> and <A
href="http://jhorning4.home.attbi.com/pro-home.html">Jim Horning</a> had the original
idea for a static checking tool for detecting inconsistencies between
LCL specifications and their C implementations.  They provided valuable
advice on its functionality and design and were instrumental in its
development.  </p>


<p>Splint incorporates the
original LCL checker developed by Yang Meng Tan.  This was built on the DECspec
Project (Joe Wild, Gary Feldman, Steve Garland, and Bill McKeeman).  The LSL
checker used by LCLint was developed by Steve Garland.  The original C grammar
for LCLint was provided by Nate Osgood.  This work has also benefited greatly
from discussions with Mike Burrows, <A

Pogosyants, Avneesh Saxena, Seejo Sebastine, Navneet 
Singh, Raymie Stata, Yang Meng Tan, and Mark Vandevoorde.  I especially thank
Angelika Leeb for many constructive comments on improving an early version of
this document, Raymie Stata and Mark Vandevoorde for technical assistance, and
Dorothy Curtis, Paco Hope, Scott Ruffner, Christina Jackson, David Ladd, and
Jessica Greer for systems assistance.</p>

<p>Much of Splint’s development
has been driven by feedback from users in academia and industry.  Many more
people than I can mention here have made contributions by suggesting
improvements, reporting bugs, porting early versions of Splint to other
platforms.  Particularly heroic contributions have been made by Nelson Beebe,
Eric Bloodworth, Jutta Degener, Rick Farnbach, Chris Flatters, Huver Hu,
Alexander Mai, John Gerard Malecki, Thomas G. McWilliams, Michael Meskes,
Richard O’Keefe, 
<a href="http://www.schweikhardt.net/">Jens Schweikhardt</a>, Albert
L. Ting and Jim Zelenka. <a href="http://herbert.the-little-red-haired-girl.org/en">
Martin &#147;Herbert&#148; Dietze</a> and Mike Smith performed valiantly in producing the original
Win32 and OS2 ports.  Tim Van Holder produced the <span class=Keyword><span
style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;color:windowtext'>automake</span></span>
and <span class=Keyword><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Arial;
color:windowtext'>autoconf</span></span> distribution.  </p>

<p>Splint research at the University
 of Virginia is currently funded in part by a grant from the NASA Langley Research
 Center, an NSF CAREER Award for swarm programming, and an NSF CCLI Award for
using analysis to teach software engineering.  David Larochelle is funded by a
USENIX student research grant.   <span style='font-size:20.0pt'> </span></p>
