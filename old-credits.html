<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans">David Evans</a> is the
primary designer and programmer of Splint.  Splint is developed by the
Secure Programming Research Group at the <a
href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu">University of Virginia Department of
Computer Science</a>.

<p>


Splint is the successor to LCLint, a tool that was developed by David
Evans while he was a graduate student at the MIT Lab for Computer
Science supervised by <A HREF="http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/~guttag/">John
Guttag</A>.
<p>

<A HREF="http://www.sds.lcs.mit.edu/~guttag/">John Guttag</A> and
<A HREF="http://www.star-lab.com/horning/">Jim
Horning</A> had the original idea for LCLint, have provided valuable
advice on its functionality and design, and been instrumental in its
development.  This work has also benefited greatly from discussions with
Mike Burrows, <A
HREF="http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~garland/">Stephen Garland</A>,
Colin Godfrey, Steve Harrison, Yanlin Huang, Daniel Jackson, John Knight,
<a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~drl7x/">David Larochelle</a>,
<A

HREF="http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~ulana/">Ulana Legedza</a>, <A Anya
Pogosyants, Avneesh Saxena, Seejo Sebastine, Navneet Singh, <A

HREF="http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~ymtan">Yang Meng Tan</A>, and
<A HREF="http://larch-www.lcs.mit.edu:8001/~mtv">Mark Vandevoorde</A>.
I especially thank Angelika Leeb for many constructive comments on
improving the User's Guide, Raymie Stata for help designing and setting
up the web site and Mark Vandevoorde for technical assistance.  <p> Much
of Splint's development has been driven by feedback from users in
academia and industry.  Many more people than I can mention here have
made contributions by suggesting improvements, reporting bugs, porting
early versions of Splint to other platforms.  Particularly heroic
contributions have been made by Eric Bloodworth, Jutta Degener, Rick
Farnbach, Chris Flatters, Huver Hu, John Gerard Malecki, Thomas G.
McWilliams, Michael Meskes, Richard O'Keefe, <a href="http://www.schweikhardt.net/">Jens Schweikhardt</a>, and
Albert L. Ting.  <a href="http://herbert.the-little-red-haired-girl.org/en">
Martin &#147;Herbert&#148; Dietze</a> and Mike Smith performed
valiantly in producing Win32 and OS/2 ports.

Splint incorporates the original LCL checker developed by Yang Meng Tan.
This was built on the DECspec Project (Joe Wild, Gary Feldman, Steve
Garland, and Bill McKeeman).  The LSL checker used by Splint was
developed by Steve Garland.  The original C grammar for Splint was
provided by Nate Osgood.

This research was supported by grants from ARPA (N0014-92-J-1795), NSF
(9115797-CCR) and DEC ERP.  Splint research is currently funded in
part by NASA Langley Research Center.  David Evans is also supported
by an NSF CAREER Award.  As a graduate student, David Evans was
supported by an Intel Foundation Fellowship.  Splint was developed on
DEC Alpha and DECmips machines provided by Digital Equipment
Corporation and Pentium II machines donated by Intel.  The Win32
version of Splint was produced using Visual Studio software donated by
Microsoft.  This document was produced using Pentium II Computers
donated by Intel Corporation and Microsoft Office software donated by
Microsoft.
