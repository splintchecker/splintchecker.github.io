Subject: Re: FILE object resource leaks

The problem is, it's not a leak to never fclose() a FILE, unless you
terminate abnormally.  Or, at least, it's guaranteed that they're closed
at termination... How would we represent that?

It's actually fairly hard to identify a memory leak which recovers before
termination; I had a bug like this, where my program would get up into
the 20-30 MB range, even though it was only *using* about 20k of memory,
but since it freed it all before exiting, it was fairly hard to tell.
