I must admit that I was first a bit offended by Richard Brooksby's
remark, but then remembered that I had made similar remarks to collegues
myself in other contexts where I told them to try to believe the
computer. I then reconsidered the code and found that rewriting made it
in fact less complex and, as you say, easier to understand and maintain.
