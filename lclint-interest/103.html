Hi to everybody on the list!

Like everbody, I was asked to give a short introduction to myself and
the hows and whys of my interest in LCLint. Well, last Friday I came
across LCLint (2.1a on Linux) and it was interesting enough to keep me
busy a few hours on the weekend. 

>From the signature you see that I am working at the institute IITB of
the Fraunhofer Gesellschaft, which is one of the largest non-profit
research institutions in Germany working on public as well as on
private research contracts. Here at the IITB (about 190 people)
we cover about everthing where computers are fed real-world signals
from sensors to make some sense out of them. That is, image
interpretation and (digital) signal processing are major fields.

Personally I am involved in projects about combustion engine diagnosis
and railway/train diagnosis. How this fits together? Well, there is
rotating machinery involved in both cases and we are quite fit in
working with signals digitized synchronous to the rotation.

And what does this all have to do with LCLint? We do quite a bit of
programming in C. This brings me back to  last Friday, where tried
LCLint on
  o a new library I just implemented to work with our favorite data
    format, 
  o code generated from clig, the 'command line interpreter generator',
    which is a nice getopt-replacement that generates code from a simple
    specification file  to break down argc and argv.

I found 
  o one error in the library (a macro parameter used without
    parentheses), 
  o a few lines of code which might make problems
    porting to other machines or compilers (mainly free mixing of
    integral types) 
  o a bunch of code where LCLint has different ideas of good coding
    (mainly use of values not equal to zero equivalent to TRUE)
  o and some code concerning memory management where I cannot convince
    LCLInt that it is really ok. 

I'll send some question and comments concerning the last point in
another mail. 

In general, I think LCLint is great and I am already thinking about
forcing our to students to use it. I'm not sure about my
colleges. Some of them might experience a frustration they don't want
to stand :-)

That's it for now,

	Harald Kirsch
