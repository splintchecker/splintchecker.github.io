I'm currently writing a review for a German computer magazine
that compares the SVR4 standard lint with Lclint and Gimpel's
FlexeLint.

With a small test program, I noticed that Lclint does complain
about an ignored return value of a locally declared function with
"int"-result, but it doesn't complain in case of printf.  I suppose
this is intended behavior, as many programs ignore printf's return
value, but I didn't find anything about it in the documentation.

Please be patient with me if I just didn't look hard enough, the
time schedule for that article does not allow me to read completely
through the several hundred pages and there's no index where I could
have a look for "printf" or "ignored return value".

Also, PLEASE answer by mail as I'm currently not a subscriber of
that list.
