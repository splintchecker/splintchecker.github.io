Hi there:

The only free and useful coverage tool available to the community is GCT
(Generic Coverage Tool), developed and distributed by Brian Marick.  The tool
has been available for many years, and is in a very stable condition.

Tcov is fine but it is limited to Statement coverage (the lowest possible
coverage requirement).
GCT, however, goes all the way to loop coverage.
