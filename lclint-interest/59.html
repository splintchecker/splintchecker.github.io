Problem 1:

OK, let me be more specific.  I'm now trying this on a solaris machine with the same 
(similiar) results:

1.  the makefile _is_ setting gcc -E.  configure set it this way. 
2.  using the -I setting just changes the location of the parse error from the system 
includes to gcc's includes.  It's in <sys/stat.h>. 
3.  I ran truss on lclint's processing of a file with a single line: #include <sys/stat.h>
   What appears to happen is lclint pre-preprocesses (!) the source file using the headers
in /usr/include, stores a temporary file, it then runs gcc -E on the temporary file, which 
of course, uses gcc's header files. 
4.  When I set BASEPATH and DEFAULT_SYSTEMDIR in constants.h and SYSTEM_LIBDIR in the Makefile
to gnu's directories, the problem goes away. 

My conclusion is that lclint assumes that system header files are in /usr/include for this 
pre-preprocess step.  This isn't a good assumption, IMHO.   Why does it need to 
side-step gcc -E?  

Problem 2:

- defining __asm__ as nothing seems to work, or we can patch gcc's header file for i86 
machines, I guess.
