You should consider improving support for internal storage (reference: LUG 5.2.7) 
 It's unreasonable to require an existing API's types to be changed just to 
annotate inner storage.  Example:

/* this function returns and int * in resp which is read-only */
int foo(/*@special@*/ int **resp)  /*@observer *resp@*/; 

It would be ideal if you could apply of the usual suspects (out, only, dependent, observer, etc)
to arguments in this fashion, in addition to the ones you defined above.
