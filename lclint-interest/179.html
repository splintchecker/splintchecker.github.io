OK, that's good to know. But first I need some time to study the archive
and gain experience with lclint, since right now I'm still getting to
grips with the volume of diagnostics it emits for programs that Sun's lint
can't see anything wrong with :-)

Well, the message is fine as it stands, but maybe you could add a sentence
to the effect that you don't need to be a professional developer or CS
theorist to contribute? If you do that, though, perhaps you should also
emphasise the existence of the archive, to avoid the list filling up with
FAQ's. 

Well, I'm off to do my homework.
Best regards,
