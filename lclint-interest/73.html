It would be very useful to have libraries like this, but as far as I
know they don't exist and we have no plans (or resources) to create
them.  Currently, only the ANSI Standard library (two versions,
depending on the strictness of checking desired) and a UNIX library
(based on what is available on *most* unixes) included in the lclint
distribution are available.  I hope lclint users will provide annotated
versions of various standards and system header files, and I'll add
these to the lclint releases if they become available.

Adding appropriate lclint annotations to the header files for a given
standard should be fairly painless, as long as reasonable header files
and documentation can be found.  I'm not sure about the posix and svid 3
standards, but a major difficulty in creating the ANSI standard version
of the library is that the documentation (in this case, the ANSI
Standard) is often very unclear about interfaces for these functions
(e.g., which pointer parameters can be null, does the return value point
to storage that must be deallocated or is it a local buffer, what
parameters are valid).  One hopes eventually standards will be
documented in a more precise way, but I'm not counting on this happening
anytime soon.
