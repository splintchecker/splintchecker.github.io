I didn't mean to suggest that it is okay for LCLint to typecheck
standard C programs differently than C does.  But, I do need to
understand what the rules are before I can implement this correctly.

As far as I can find, the standard doesn't have any explanation of
implicit function pointers, it just seems to be something
implementations have adopted because of traditions.  I must be missing
something, but nothing I can find in the standard indicates that func1
and func1 * should be the same type.  In fact, it seems to directly
contradict what I read in Sec 3.5.4.1: "For two pointer types to be
compatible, both shall be identically qualified and both shall be
pointers to compatible types."
