Subject: FILE object resource leaks


One way to handle this would be to make up a new abstract type to
represent FILE *.  We pretend that the file pointer returned by fopen is
only, and force the close operation to be called.  For example,

filePointer.h:

typedef /*@abstract@*/ /*@null@*/ FILE *filePointer;

/*@constant null filePointer filePointer_undefined@*/
# define filePointer_undefined (NULL)

extern filePointer filePointer_open (char *, char *);
extern int filePointer_close (/*@only@*/ filePointer);

/* ... need wrappers for other FILE function here ... */

filePointer.c:

# include <stdio.h>
# include "bool.h"
# include "filePointer.h"

filePointer filePointer_open (char *path, char *mode)
{
  /*@-dependenttrans@*/ return (fopen (path, mode)); /*@=dependenttrans@*/
  /* without the -dependenttrans, lclint reports:
     filePointer.c:7,10: Dependent storage returned as implicitly only:
                            (fopen(path, mode))
     since fopen returns a dependent pointer.  We want to pretend it
     is only, to force filePointer_close to be called.
  */
}

int filePointer_close (/*@only@*/ filePointer f)
{
  if (f != filePointer_undefined) {
    /*@-mustfree@*/ return (fclose (f)); /*@=mustfree@*/  
    /* Without -mustfree, lclint would report::
          filePointer.c:19,25: Only storage f not released before return
       since we are only pretenting the filePointer's are only
       to force the filePointer_close call.
     */
  } else {
    return 0;
  }
}


Then, a user file filePointer will get lclint messages if the open/close
semantics is not followed correctly:

void f ()
{
  filePointer f1 = filePointer_open ("test", "r");
  filePointer f2 = filePointer_open ("test", "r");
  filePointer f3 = filePointer_open ("test", "r");

  /* ... */

  free (f1);
  filePointer_close (f2);
}

usefile.c: (in function f)
usefile.c:13,9: Function free expects arg 1 to be void * gets
filePointer: f1
  Types are incompatible. (-type will suppress message)
usefile.c:14,3: Return value (type int) ignored: filePointer_clos...
  Result returned by function call is not used. If this is intended, can cast
  result to (void) to eliminate message. (-retvalint will suppress message)
usefile.c:15,2: Fresh storage f3 not released before return
  A memory leak has been detected. Newly-allocated or only-qualified storage is
  not released before the last reference to it is lost. (-mustfree will 
  suppress message)

Yes, I agree that something like this would be useful (but have no plans
to implement it).
