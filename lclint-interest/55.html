Interests: 

I'm looking at lclint as a tool to help improve the quality of 
(almost) a million line code base.  Long term goal is to run 
lclint on about 9 different unix platforms w/gcc as well as NT w/vc. 

I'm also interested in anyone's comments on the viability of this goal. 

Comments:

I haven't actually _used_ lclint yet, but I have a comments on 
the installation.  To run the tests under Unixware 1.12, I 
had to split up "UNITTESTS" into six lists to keep from hitting
the command line limit.  Otherwise no unusual problems were 
encountered.
