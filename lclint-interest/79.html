Let's see where to start. I am a German computer science student in his
last semesters. While studying I stumbled about quite a lot programming
languages, C was of course one of them. I used it esp. for programming in
an UNIX environment, but I use it for programming my Amiga, too.

At this point I may remark, that lclint is compilable under AmigaOS after
changing a few points. First, the makefile has to be edited by hand,
because the configure is aimed for UNIX systems. The second and main point
is the search path handling. The Amiga uses different devices that are
denoted by a name and a colon. Therefor I changed the separating colon to a
comma. Another, at the moment quite less important point, is the fact, that
lclint adds a slash "/" to each path. But "harddisk:" may denote a correct
path on an Amiga, while "harddisk:/" may create problems. Perhaps lclint
can be changed a bit: Paths in the search lists should be ended by slashes,
therefor stopping the need to add the slash by lclint.

Is it possible to add some list-specific header to the outgoing mails?
Something like "X-LCLINT" to allow automatic processing of the mails by a
mailfilter?

Well, I just start with lclint. Perhaps someone may tell me about some of
the best features of lclint? (Of course all of them are in the manual, but
I am interested in reading about often _used_ features.)

80??? I find 51 in this list!?!


Feel free to ask me if you want anything more to know about me. BTW: I
would appreciate correcting my spelling or grammar faults. :-)
