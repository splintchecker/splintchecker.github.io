Hi,

I'm a s/w engineer looking at improving testing techniques for this
portion of Alcatel.  We're developing embedded systems testing them on
host (SunOS) and target (MTOS) architectures.The aim is to be able to run
the majority of the same tests on host and target. By no means an easy
task!

We're going to initially use lclint as a decent lint tool. After that,
we'll see how it goes.... We're going to use Purify to catch dynamic
memory problems and we'll be evaluating Cantata (from IPL) as a testing
tool.

As for lclint - how about doing something like Meyers book for Code Wizard
but for C. There's a classic book about the Traps and Pitfalls of C by
Koenig - I'm sure it would be very difficult to implement but a great
challenge!

Also, what about introducing metrics such as code complexity measurements
into lclint. I realise that they must be taken with a pinch of salt but
can be good indicators of dodgey practices.

Regards,
Vin
