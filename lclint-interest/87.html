This is a good point, I hadn't considered.  

Richard O'Keefe's suggestion to treat formal parameters in protoypes as
a separate namespace sounds like a good idea --- I'll add this to the
next minor version.  

Its often useful to have some name there for documentation, so some
checking to relate the names used in the prototype to the names in the
definition might be useful.  Perhaps it should be an option to generate
a message when the name in the prototype after removing the namespace
prefix does not match the definition name.  

The other suggested checks/flags all seem useful (and trivial to
implement, except perhaps sizeofformalarray) so I'll add these to the
next minor version.

Good idea...don't see any reason not to do this.
