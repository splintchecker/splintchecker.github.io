Hi!

As co-chair of the 8th Workshop on Software Reuse (WISR8), to be held
March 23-26, 1997, at The Ohio State University, I would like to
invite you to submit a position paper for the workshop.  If you visit
the WISR8 home page:

  http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~weide/WISR8/

you'll find a rather complete description of WISR8 plans and
instructions for submitting a position paper, which is required in
order to be invited to attend the workshop.

If for some reason you cannot access the above URL then please let me
know by e-mail (weide@cis.ohio-state.edu) and I will send you the most
important information by e-mail or by post.

  IF YOU ARE PLANNING TO SUBMIT A POSITION PAPER TO WISR8 THEN PLEASE
  DROP ME A SHORT E-MAIL NOTE ASAP SO WE CAN GET AN EARLY IDEA OF THE
  LIKELY RESPONSE.

And, of course, please forward this invitation to others in your
organization who might be interested in participating in WISR8.

Thanks in advance for your support of WISR8.

    -Bruce

PS - My apologies if you received two or more copies of this via
different e-mail addresses.  The WISR8 mailing list is a combination
of lists from the past two WISRs and ICSRs along with some other
addresses of people I thought might like to receive this note.  There
are some duplicate names (although no duplicate e-mail addresses :-)
in the combined list, but I am not sure which addresses are current.
