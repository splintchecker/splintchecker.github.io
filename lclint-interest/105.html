Subject: (Known?) Bugs? of LCLint and questions

The problem here is that lclint doesn't interpret !s.  If the comparison
is written as 

	if (s != NULL)   or    if (!(s == NULL))

then the error is not reported since lclint determines that s must be
either deallocated or NULL (i.e., it does not point to any storage) at
the point before the assignment.

(LCLint should be able to determine that !s means the same thing, but it
doesn't.)

The most current version is 2.2a.  For release notes, see:

True.  The way the standard library defines realloc, (in ansi.h)

extern /*@null@*/ /*@out@*/ /*@only@*/ void *
   realloc (/*@null@*/ /*@only@*/ /*@special@*/ void *p, 
	    size_t size) /*@modifies *p@*/ ;

still doesn't satisfactorily capture the complete meaning of realloc.

Actually, the distributed version of the standard library defined
realloc incorrectly as:

extern /*@null@*/ /*@out@*/ /*@only@*/ void *
   realloc (/*@null@*/ /*@out@*/ /*@only@*/ /*@returned@*/ void *p, 
            size_t size) /*@modifies *p@*/ ;

Note the use of only and returned together doesn't make much sense.
Only means the caller shouldn't rely on the reference after the call, so
it shouldn't matter to the caller if the reference is returned (as far
as the caller is concerned, this should be no different from a new
reference).  

The use of out is also a bit misleading --- realloc doesn't define the
storage p points to.  What we really want is to say the storage p points
to need not be defined before the call, and it is in the same state
after the call.  This is the meaning of the /*@special@*/ annotation,
when we don't use any special clauses.

Still, this doesn't fully capture the effect of realloc, since when
realloc fails it returns null but does not deallocate p (as the only
annotation requires).  

One way of wrapping realloc would be to make a version that doesn't
return NULL when it fails, but returns p and using another parameter as
the error code.  Something like,

extern /*@null@*/ /*@out@*/ /*@only@*/ void *
   safe_realloc (/*@null@*/ /*@only@*/ /*@special@*/ void *p, 
                 size_t size,
	         /*@out@*/ bool *ok) 
   /*@modifies *p, *ok@*/ 
{
  *ok = TRUE;
  
  if (p == NULL) { return (malloc (size)); }
  else {
    void *res = realloc (p, size);
    
    if (res == NULL) {
      *ok = FALSE;
      /*@-usereleased@*/
      return p; 
      /*@=usereleased@*/
    } else {
      return res;
    }
  }
}

This message is getting a bit long, so I'll reply to your points 3 and 4
in a separate message.
