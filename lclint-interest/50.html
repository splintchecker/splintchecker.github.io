Subject: Specifying a side-effect-free parameter.  (Spec. vs Annotation)


Just to elaborate on John's message, all the source-code annotations
except the /*@abstract@*/ and /*@concrete@*/ type definition tags (since
specs have a different way of declaring abstract types) can be used in
LCL specifications with the same meaning as they have in source-code.
For a complete list of annotations, you can do lclint -help annotations.

The LCL annotations should be as robust as source-code one, but I've
focused most of my testing on source-code annotations.  If you could,
please send me the example that is producing this error.

Thanks,
