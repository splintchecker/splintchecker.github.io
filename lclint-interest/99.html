If you do employ lclint's memory checking also, it'll be interesting to
see what kinds of errors are more effectively detected at run-time vs.
compile-time.

Some of the checks done by LCLint are indirectly inspired by the "Traps
and Pitfalls" book (in particular the macro checking), and some others
are from Van der Linden, "Expert C Programming: Deep C Secrets" book.  I
don't have a copy of "Traps and Pitfalls" handy, but my recollection is
that some of the problems are things that were corrected by the ANSI
standard.

Yes, adding metrics to lclint has been suggested by a number of people.
I presume some of the standard metrics could be added quite easily
(although I have no plans to do this --- but the source code is
available if anyone wants to give it a try).  More interesting would be
to consider devising new kinds of metrics that exploit the extra
information available to lclint (e.g., abstraction barriers, shared
pointers, clean interfaces), although I don't have any specific ideas as
to what would be useful here in a metric.
