There is an emacs mode included with the lclint distribution in
emacs/lclint.el.  This defines lclint-next-error which will jump to the
line and column number of the next error message in your *lclint*
buffer.  Please see
http://lclint.cs.virginia.edu/guide/appH.html for more
information on emacs support.
