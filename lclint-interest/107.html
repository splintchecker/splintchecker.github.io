I am a PhD student at the University of Milano.  My main field of
interest is in derivation of programs, usually by means of
paper-and-pencil.  I also did some work with automated theorem proving
systems, mostly HOL.  I like HOL, but I prefer to concentrate on
finding nice notations and formalisms to make derivations simpler and
crisper.  

While I think that learning program derivation techniques greatly
enhances one's programming skills, it is clear that these techniques
are not sufficient.  I'm very much in favor of powerful static
analysis tools, rather than powerful debuggers.

My interest in lclint is simply for personal use in my programming
work.  Speaking of which, since I do most of my programming on the
Macintosh, I hope to be able to use lclint to check Mac C code.  There
are a few C extensions that are commonplace on the Mac; for instance
this is a common idiom in header files:

	pascal void Debugger(void) = 0xA9FF;

and also this:

	short ApFontID:0x984;

(the latter means that variable ApFontID should be found at the given
address). 

My plan is to copy a set of Mac header files to a Linux machine, and
edit them to take away all this clutter.  Then I could check my Mac
sources on Linux.

As far as I understand, in order to fully benefit from lclint I should
also add annotations to function prototypes; it is a daunting task
since there are several hundreds of them.  If someone else interested
we could share some work (I do a few headers, you do some others).

Regards,

Matteo Vaccari

Hello everybody on the list,

After my subscription to this list, I got the following message back:

So here I go:

My name is Erik Mouw and I am a M.Sc. student in electrical
engineering at the Delft University of Technology (T.U. Delft). I am
a member of the Information Theory group. Currently I am working on
error concealment techniques for MPEG-2 video bit streams over ATM
networks, and therefore I'm to changing (hacking?) an MPEG-2 decoder.

I started using lclint because I wanted a lint on my Linux machine at
home. After some experiments I became more and more interested in
lclint and discovered that it is much more powerful than the standard
lint that we use over here on our Sun Sparc machines. I like the
memory management checks in lclint and I've already discovered some
memory leaks in my code.

I'm the first in our group (AFAIK) who uses lclint, there are already
people asking about "those fancy comments" in my C code, but nobody
is really really convinced -- yet.

I'm currently fighting with the right annotations for a double linked
list. This is what I currently use:

typedef /*@abstract@*/ struct node
{
  /*@null@*/ /*@shared@*/ struct node * next;
  /*@null@*/ /*@shared@*/ struct node * prev;
  int val;
} node;


/* start of the list */
/*@null@*/ /*@shared@*/ static node * start=NULL;

/* the current node */
/*@null@*/ static node * cur=NULL;

/* end of the list */
/*@null@*/ /*@shared@*/ static node * end=NULL;

Is this OK or should I use other annotations?

Just a little idea: As gcc is the only C compiler on the Linux
platform, I sometimes have to run lclint with +gnuextensions. Gcc has
a nice __FUNCTION__ macro that expands to a string with the name of
the current function (useful for debugging), but the problem is that
it is expanded in the compiler, not in the preprocessor. Therefore,
lclint thinks it is an undefined variable. The solution is to add the
-D__FUNCTION__="anyfunction" to the commandline (thanks Dave!), but
maybe it is a good idea to enable this automagicaly when you enable
+gnuextensions.


Regards,
Erik
