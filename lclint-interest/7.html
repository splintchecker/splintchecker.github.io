dave,

you should be well aware how much i like lclint.  i think it is a
wonderfully useful tool and mention it's use to all my cohorts.

recently i have been working with franc,ois pinard to enhance the gnu
m4 macro language processor.  i have converted the eval() mechanism to
work with a multi-precision library package and not the native C
operators.  we have not yet released this version as we are still
experimenting with certain features but the brunt of the enhancement
(conversion) is complete.

gnu m4 is distributed with source code.  one goal of the enhancement
was to allow the user to select the eval() mechanism at compile time.
we specifically opted for this compile-time selection and not a
run-time selection.  iused lclint to help me perform the conversion.

thanks to lclint i was able to effect the conversion in a multi-step,
goal oriented fashion.  first i wrote a small lcl spec and ran lclint.
directed by the lclint error messages i converted all of the
representation explicit operations to use the abstract interface.

next i wrote an implementation of the interface using the native C
operators.  now i could compare the old implementation with the new.

next i wrote an implementation using the extended precision library.
the job went surprisingly quick.  using lclint gave me a certain
confidence which "carried through".  in the past, when performing
these types of enhancements quite often an error at a particular stage
of abstraction would not be caught until much later.  one then spends
a bit of time tracking down the problem.  this time, and i presume it
was due to using lclint, this only occured once.

as you seem to be doing research in the area of using tools like
lclint if you have any specific questions please feel free to ask me.
i'll do my best to answer them.

-thanks

PS - the only problem which occured, and i believe there really is a
solution at hand, has to do with object creation and deletion.  a
classic example of the original code is

	static eval_error
	add_term (eval_token et, eval_t *v1)
	{
	  eval_token op;
	  eval_t v2;
	  eval_error er;
	 
	  if ((er = mult_term (et, v1)) != NO_ERROR)
	    return er;
	 
	  while ((op = eval_lex (&v2)) == PLUS || op == MINUS)
	    {
	      et = eval_lex (&v2);
	      if (et == ERROR)
	        return UNKNOWN_INPUT;
	 
	      if ((er = mult_term (et, &v2)) != NO_ERROR)
	        return er;
	 
	      if (op == PLUS)
	        *v1 = *v1 + v2;
	      else
	        *v1 = *v1 - v2;
	    }
	  if (op == ERROR)
	    return UNKNOWN_INPUT;
	 
	  eval_undo ();
	  return NO_ERROR;
	}

this was converted to

	static eval_error
	add_term (eval_token et, eval_t *v1)
	{
	  eval_token op;
	  eval_t v2;
	  eval_error er;
	 
	  if ((er = mult_term (et, v1)) != NO_ERROR)
	    return er;
	 
*	  numb_init(v2);
	  while ((op = eval_lex (&v2)) == PLUS || op == MINUS)
	    {
	      et = eval_lex (&v2);
	      if (et == ERROR)
	        return UNKNOWN_INPUT;
	 
	      if ((er = mult_term (et, &v2)) != NO_ERROR)
	        return er;
	 
	      if (op == PLUS)
	        numb_plus(v1,v1,&v2);
	      else
	        numb_minus(v1,v1,&v2);
	    }
*	  numb_fini(v2);
	  if (op == ERROR)
	    return UNKNOWN_INPUT;
	 
	  eval_undo ();
	  return NO_ERROR;
	}

the error that i made was not recognizing the need of adding the first
of the *-d statements.  i could swear that i can specify the need for
numb_init() to be called but i haven't yet figured out how.
