I have ported lclint to DOS/Win32 (with the aid of the Borland DOS extender 
so it runs on plain DOS or as a console-mode WinNT/Win95 program).  I 
haven't got around to finding out if I can upload anyhwere, but I will send 
it to anyone who wants it.

Hi,

My name is Bartosz Polednia. I have graduated Academy of Mining and
Metallurgy in Cracow, Poland, with M.D. in computer science.
Now, I am working as consultant and programmer in small company which
mainly writes software for Polish Government (Ministry of Health). My
company is also ISP.

My intrest in LCLint is mainly hobbyist. I use C/C++ for my home
programming and I like to improve my style so I am looking for
lint-like tool.

Because I mainly use plain DOS so I have no chance to try lclint yet.
I am interested if there is alredy DOS version prepared ? If no, I am
ready to prepare one.

Regards,

Bartosz.
