I'd claim there is a fair bit of experience to the contrary --- for
example, the lclint source code is annotated fairly completely (and I
would claim this as a non-trivial program).  

In general, though, a design goal of lclint is that it is flexible
enough that a programmer can choose a level of annotations best suited
to a particular program, and control checking accordingly.  The goal of
adding annotations to a program is to enable better checking and
detection of errors that otherwise would not be found (as well as to
provide clearer documentation to make maintainence easier).

This is quite likely true --- many of the problems lclint attempts to
detect are undecidable (e.g., it is impossible to analyze aliases
completely).  When lclint is reporting an error for something, but you
are convinced there is no problem in the code, use a syntactic comment
to suppress the warning (and document the problem).

By itself, you can't really tell what annotations in the header file.
Annotations in the header file would help a programmer know how to use
the interface you are providing, and enable lclint to check that the
implementation code is consistent with this interface.  

For an example, you probably want:

typedef struct s_Dyla {
  size_t size;		     /* currently allocated elems in v */
  unsigned short minAddSize; /* min num of elems to add on realloc */
  unsigned short sizof;      /* size of the elements in v */
  size_t ff;                 /* first free entry in v */
  /*@only@*/ void *v;
} *Dyla;

The /*@only@*/ annotion on v mean it is the only pointer to that
storage, and the storage must be deallocated before this reference is
lost.

I tried downloading the code, but it depends on some header files that
are not available on my system.  Perhaps what would be more instructive,
is if you post a stylized fragment of the program that illustrates the
kind of problems you mean.
