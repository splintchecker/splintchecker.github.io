Subject: lclint format-type question


Hi Albert,

In this case the important difference is that +relaxquals is set in weak
mode but not in strict or checks mode.  +relaxquals means that error are
not reported for qualifier mismatches when no data is lost.  In fact, an
error SHOULD be reported for the case where %d is scanf'd as a pointer
to short, since data could be lost, but not if it were in a printf.
(So, this is really a bug...but you'll get the message you want is
-relaxquals is set.)

--- Dave
