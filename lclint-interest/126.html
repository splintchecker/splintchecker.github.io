I had a very similar problem (but hairier) that I reported to David.
I still haven't seen any comment about it.

The base problem is mixing abstract types with null pointers. What fails
is that `abstract types' is a well-defined version, whereas null-checking
is ad-hoc linting, and they don't mix well.

Briefly, try to define a type with a distinguished value used to denote 
errors. Then implement it. A reasonable implementation may use pointers, with
the NULL pointer to denote that value.
Since this is an abstract type, we want to name that NULL as a constant of
the required abstract type, and test against it.

Then try to get the abstract type working, considering it should NOT have
any annotations concerning the NULL pointer, then the implementation,
concerning it DOES need annotations concerning the NULL pointer.

IMHO, lclint is missing an `abstract NULL pointer' (well, distinguished 
value), with the corresponding mechanisms to handle it, a generalized 
version of the /*@null@*/ et al annotations.
