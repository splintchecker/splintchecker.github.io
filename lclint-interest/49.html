Subject: Include files and the CPP


Sorry for the slow responses, I was out of town last week.

There is no easy way to this.  LCLint runs its own preprocessor on the
source files first to prevent macro expansion, and then uses the C
preprocessor (as set by the LCLINT_CPPCMD environment variable.)  It
should probably handle error messages in a better way, but for now they
just appear on standard error.  LCLint does run all the files through
cpp at once, so you may get redefinition errors that don't appear in
standard compilation.  A future release of lclint may handle
preprocessing better (I'd like to have an integrated preprocessor
instead of having to use an extra pass and a system call).

One temporary solution would be do use

	# ifndef __LCLINT__
	# define ...  
	# endif

around the macro redefinitions that are producing errors.
