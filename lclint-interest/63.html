The code sample was an example of the kind of leaks which it would be
useful for us to be able to detect with lclint.  Essentially, the programmer
allocates a structure on the stack and then calls a function to
allocate storage associated with the structure.  There is usually other 
fields in the structure that the caller has access to. If the programmer 
doesn't call the corresponding deallocation function on the structure 
before returning from the function in which it was allocated on the 
stack, it is usually a leak.  

This technique is mainly used to reduce
the number of heap allocations needed for a software object.  Instead of 
allocating the booga_s structure and then the variable sized data, 
only the variable sized data need be allocated on the heap.  
In the example, I should have made "bar" variable sized to be clearer.  

These kinds of allocations are rampant throughout our code-base, 
and it probably wouldn't make as much sense to use lclint
if it can't help with them.  Are there any plans to add the kind 
of annotations that would allow the detection of this leak?  
Something like: 

extern int alloc_booga_s(booga_s *stuff, <other params>) /*@creates *stuff@*/;
extern void free_booga_s(booga_s *stuff)  /*@destroys *stuff@*/;

A more general solution (I'm guessing) would be a minor(?) extension 
of the annotation syntax to the fields of structures:

extern int alloc_booga_s(booga_s *stuff /*@out stuff->bar@*/); 
extern int free_booga_s(booga_s *stuff /*@in stuff->bar@*/); 

>From the messages lclint produces, it seems like it already 
keeps track of the state of structure fields, there's just no way 
to express the above with the current annotation syntax.
