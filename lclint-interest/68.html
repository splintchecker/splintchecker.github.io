Hello.

My name is Pete Buechler, I am a principal engineer (peon with some experience)
at Honeywell Air Transport Systems Division here in Phoenix, Arizona, USA. I 
work in the Integrated Modular Avionics (IMA) group. We build avionics platforms
capable of running several different functions which would once have been 
implemented in separate boxes. We do not write the applications, other groups 
at Honeywell do that. We just supply a platform.

This software is classified as "level A" by the US Federal Aviation
Administration, meaning that people's lives may be endangered if it fails, 
which means that it must be developed and tested using quite rigorous 
methodologies.

Until recently, the embedded software here was developed in Ada. For a variety of
reasons, mostly having to do with efficiency and flexibility, we are migrating
to C. One nice thing that Ada provides is strong type checking and strict
enforcement of interfaces. C does not, but I am hoping that LCLint will.

I am new here, only four months on the job, but I am not totally new to the
software business. I have a BS in Electrical from the University of Florida,
a MS in Computer Engineering from Florida Atlantic University, and eight years
of industrial experience developing real-time and embedded software in the 
aerospace, telecommunications and laser printer fields.

I am evaluating LCLint now, and if it looks like it will do a good job then
I will try "selling" the other engineers here on it. This may or may not
succeed, this is a quite bureaucratic environment and resists change of any
form. Perhaps I will just use it myself, we will see.

Any way, so far it seems like a good tool. I installed it with little problem
and I have run it on some of my (unannotated) code with useful results. David 
Evans has apparently done quite a lot of work to get this thing where it is 
today.

-Pete-
