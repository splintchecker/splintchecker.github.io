This is okay, but using "shared" means there won't be much checking and
it doesn't say much about host the list should be used (i.e., how should
I deallocate a list?).

This is a good example of where the owned and dependent annotations are
useful.  Owned means that this declarator is responsible for the storage
it points to (even though other dependent-annotated pointers may also
point to the same storage).  Either the next or the prev pointers could
be the owners --- here we view the list looking forward and make next
the owner:

===========
typedef /*@abstract@*/ struct node
{
  /*@null@*/ /*@owned@*/ struct node * next;
  /*@null@*/ /*@dependent@*/ struct node * prev;
  int val;
} node;

/* start of the list */
/*@null@*/ /*@owned@*/ static node * start=NULL;

/* the current node */
/*@null@*/ /*@dependent@*/ static node * cur=NULL;

/* end of the list */
/*@null@*/ /*@dependent@*/ static node * end=NULL;

void dll_insert (int x) /*@modifies *cur@*/
{
  if (cur != NULL) {
    struct node *nn = (struct node *) malloc (sizeof (*nn));
    assert (nn != NULL);
    nn->next = cur->next;
    nn->prev = cur;
    nn->val = x;
    if (cur->next != NULL) {
      cur->next->prev = nn;
    }

    cur->next = nn; /* note: I forgot this line when coding this...but, because
		       of the owned/dependent annotation lclint detected
		       the bug! */
    if (end == cur) end = nn; /* not sure if this is the right thing? */
    cur = nn;
  }
  else {
    ; /* initialize start, etc. */
  }
}

void dll_free (void) /*@modifies start, cur, end@*/
{
  /* because of the owned/dependent annotations, its clear
     what we need to free */

  while (end != NULL) {
    end = end->prev;
    if (end != NULL) { free (end->next); }
  }

  start = NULL; /* <<< lclint reports a memory leak here, since it can't tell 
		       that the loop deallocated start eventually. If the double
		       linked-list is maintained correctly, it must do this, but
		       a more careful programmer would check this in the loop. */
  end = NULL;
  cur = NULL;
}

============

Because owned and dependent have more meaning that shared, the code is a
bit clearer to understand, and more importantly (as I found out when
constructing this example), its more likely that lclint will detect bugs
in the code because many of the likely errors one could make are
inconsistent with the owned/dependent annotations.
