Subject: re: signal function interface


I was confused in my last message.  In fact, the problems with lclint
are not as serious as I had thought.

This is indeed a bug in the type system, resulting from lots of
confusion about when there is an is not an implicit function pointer.  

LCLint will work correctly if you do,

	typedef void (*SignalHandlerT) (int);

instead.  

I still find the C syntax here particularily confusing.  Perhaps one of
the C standard experts on the list can help clear this up for me:

typedef int func1 (int);
typedef int (*func2) (int);

int tf (int (p1)(int), int (*p2) (int), func1, func1 *, func2);

int f1 (int);

int f (void)
{
  func1 fa;
  func2 fb;
  func1 *fap;

  fa (2);
  fb (3);
  fap (3);

  return tf (f1, f1, f1, f1, f1);
}

Is this a conforming program?  (According to all the compilers I try
there is no type error in it.  LCLint incorrectly reports 2 type errors
because of the same problem with implicit function pointers.)  

Its seems quite strange to me where you get implicit function pointers
(i.e., why func1 and func1 * are the same), and where you don't.  (Is
this explained clearly in the standard somewhere?)

Opps, its not a bug in the checking.  The standard library is incorrect,
and should declare it as Hermann suggests.
