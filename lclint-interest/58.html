I'm not sure quite what you mean here.  You can use the -I flag to
select the header directories search by lclint, just as you would do for
a C compiler.  This can be set in your ~/.lclintrc file so you don't
have to set it at the command line every time.

If you want to use gcc -E, set the LCLINT_CPPCMD environment variable to
"gcc -E".  Depending on how the Makefile was configured when you build
lclint, the default c pre-processor was set to /lib/cpp.  LCLint is
meant to be as platform independent as possible, and believe it or not,
not everyone has gcc, so /lib/cpp is the default.

I'm reluctant to start adding complier-specific syntax to lclint, and
there doesn't appear to be any real consensus as to the syntax for
including assembly in C programs.  The hope is that most compiler's that
add language extensions will do so in a way that they can be hidden by a
macro definition, and you could do something like,

	# ifdef __LCLINT__
	# define asm(x) ()
	# endif

to at least hide the syntax problems.  Unfortunately, this doesn't work
for gcc's __asm__.

The other problem with trying to support extension like this is that
unless you are very careful, you risk breaking perfectly good ANSI
programs designed for a compiler that doesn't support these conventions
(e.g., if I made asm a keyword and supported special syntax, standard
ANSI programs that use asm as an identifier would break.)
