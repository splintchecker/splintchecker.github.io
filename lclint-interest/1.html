Hi, 
  I'm Dave Spuler, an ex-academic now working in the real world, and
I'm also the author of three C/C++ books published by Prentice Hall
called "Comprehensive C", "C++ & C efficiency" and "C++ & C Debugging,
Testing, and Reliability".  My interest in lclint is part of an overall
interest in the design of all C/C++ tools, and also specifically because
I actually implemented a lint-like checker called "Check: a better checker
for C" as a student project.  Check is not available because (a) it's not
very robust as I was learning C as I wrote it and (b) I still have vague
plans to do something commercial with it.  However, there are some research
reports on it available via FTP to coral.cs.jcu.edu.au in pub/techreports
in spuler-hons.ps.gz, and also a few TR's (I forget the numbers).

Regards,
Dave
