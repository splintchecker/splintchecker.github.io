Subject: FILE object resource leaks


LCLINT AND THE C LIBRARY STREAM I/O INTERFACE.

How should LCLint deal with file handles allocated by the standard C
library stream i/o functions? What is the the proper way to annotate
pointers to FILE?. How can LCLint be used to detect resource leaks
in FILE objects?

The problem is that stream pointers are similar to pointers returned
by malloc functions. The main difference is that FILE handles are
abstract. The implementation of FILE objects is hidden from us.
However, like malloced pointers, they must be properly deallocated
through the proper function calls (usually fclose()). If we fail to
properly deallocate FILE handles we will create system memory leaks and
we could actually run out of file handles (they are usually a finite
system resource).

As things presently stand with LCLint, annotating FILE pointers, fopen(),
and fclose() with /*@only@*/ provides the best way for detecting these
sorts of FILE handle leaks. However, this has the danger of allowing
the error of passing a FILE pointer to free().  Such an error would go
undetected by this scheme.

Perhaps LCLint needs a way to register abstract allocator/deallocator
functions.  Consider an abstract object FOO. Suppose the only way to
create a FOO object is through open_foo(). Now suppose that in order to
release resources owned by a FOO object, it must be passed to close_foo().
It would be useful if there were a way for LCLint to check this at the
interface level. The standard C stream i/o library is a good example
of how LCLint as presently implemented can not properly detect certain
resource leaks.

Below is a program which illustrates the problem.
