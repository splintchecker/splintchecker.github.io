Hiya!

I've just started to set up a new project with automagic makefiles to do 
everything for me.  This includes,  as part of the compilation phase,  
running both indent and lclint over the code.  However,  I've come unstuck 
as my version of indent seems to insist on mangling lclint's embedded 
comments,  thus
"/*@unused@*/" becomes "/* @unused@ */" and so on.  

LClint (V2.2a) seems unable to cope with this and simply ignores the 
comments,  thus causing all sorts of warnings to appear.  Has anyone else 
experienced this problem and found a solution?  I could re-install a hacked 
version of LCLint where "/*@" and "/* @" were equivalent,  but I'd rather 
not have to do this if there is a better way.

Thanks in advance,

Mike.
