The real issue in LCLint is how effectively it finds bugs.  The
term "soundness" is misleading in this context because LCLint does
not perform static checking in usually accepted meaning of the term.
(What properties are being checked?)  Rather, LCLint is a programming tool
that attempts to help programmers statically identify memory bugs.  What I
would like to know is given representative programs that may or may not
have memory bugs, how often does LCLint fail to find a memory bug and
how often does it signal a false alarm.

Well, gang, any experience out there yet?
