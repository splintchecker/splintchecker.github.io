Yes, I've thought about this and it definitely would be useful.  Its
quite difficult to do something general here, but there may be partial
check that are useful.  Gimpel PC-Lint does some value checking with
array bounds.

You can usually manage by writing a macro, e.g., #define __declspec(x).
LCLint supports some of the GNU compiler extensions, but theres no limit
on the kinds of extensions compiler-writers will make.  In general, I
don't think there's anyway to easily avoid having to modify the scanner
directly if you want lclint to support a new compiler extension.

I've thought about adding some kind of metrics to lclint, but generally
find most metrics unsatisfying.  Genenerally, the programmer knows
intuitively when code is too complex.  It makes sense if an institution
want to declare some rules that all code must meet, but there are always
contrived ways to make the code satisfy the metric (and these usually
end up making the code more complex).
