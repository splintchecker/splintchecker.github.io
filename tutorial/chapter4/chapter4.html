<h1>Dynamic Memory Management</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>
In this chapter we introduce the C library functions for
allocating and deallocating memory dynamically. Allocating
memory dynamically can come in handy when it is not known
how much memory the program will need. For example a database
program may need to work both for a customer with 100 records
and for one with 10,000 records. 

<p>
We will also show you some of the common errors
associated with dynamic memory allocation, and
how Splint can help to avoid
them. 

<h2>Stack vs. Heap</h2>

<p>
In general there are two places memory can come from: the stack and
the heap. 

Up to this point we have been allocating memory from the stack:

<pre>
int main()
{
 int IntegerArray[30];

}
</pre>

<p>
This allocates enough space to hold 30 integers. The
<code>int</code> type is usually 4 bytes long, so
this would allocate 120 bytes of storage. Sometimes
allocating from the stack is all we need.

<p>
The bad thing about allocating things on the stack is that
it may not be known at compile time how much space is needed.

<p>
By allocating memory from the heap we can:
<ul>
<li>Vary the amount of space we allocate during the execution of the program
<li>Allocate memory and deallocate it only when we want to.
</ul>

<h2><code>malloc</code> and <code>free</code></h2>
<p>
The <code>malloc()</code> function dynamically allocates space
from the heap:

<PRE>
void *malloc(size_t number_of_bytes);
</PRE>

<p>
The <code>void *</code> is C's generic pointer type. You can cast the
return value of <code>malloc</code> to any actual pointer type you
like (even your own types that you define with <code>struct</code>)

So code like:
<PRE>
int *ip;
ip = (int*) malloc(size * sizeof(*ip));
</PRE>
will allocate enough space to hold <code>size</code> number of
integers. <code>sizeof</code> is an operator which returns the number
of bytes needed to hold one instance of a particular type. In this case,
for most computers <code>sizeof(*ip)</code> will return 4 since on
most computers the integer type takes up 4 bytes. 

<p>
Using <code>sizeof</code> is preferable to hard coding like this:
<PRE>
ip = (int*) malloc(size * 4);
</PRE>
since using <code>sizeof</code> makes the code more portable.

<p>
If there is no memory left on the computer then <code>malloc</code>
will return a <code>NULL</code> pointer. The NULL pointer
is guaranteed not to point at any object.

In general, whenever
a call to <code>malloc</code> is made the program should check
whether <code>malloc</code> returned <code>NULL</code>.
Probably the best way to do this would be to write a
function which takes one pointer argument, and if that pointer
is <code>NULL</code> prints out a suitable debugging message, and
exits the program. Alternatively, you could try and continue the
program without that block of memory.

<h2>Freeing Memory </h2>

<p>
Clearly you cannot just keep asking for memory, and always
getting it. The computer has limited memory resources.
If you don't need a piece of memory any more it would
be nice to be able to return that piece of memory to the
free store. 

Consider the following program:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="RunOutOfMemory.c"-->
</PRE>

<p>
If you run this program you will see that eventually
the computer does actually run out of memory, and
that <code>malloc</code> eventually returns NULL.


<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="RunOutOfMemory.output"-->
</PRE>

<p>
Splint will warn us about this program.
More specifically, it will tell us that there
is a a memory leak.

<p>
When <code>i</code> is 1 we let <code>p</code> point at a newly allocated block
of memory, but when <code>i</code> is 2 we let <code>p</code>
point at another
newly allocated block of memory. That first block of memory
is not reachable since there are no pointers to it.

<p>
Splint's output:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="RunOutOfMemory.splint"-->
</PRE>

<p>
To fix it use <code>free</code>:

<PRE>
void free(void* ptr);
</PRE>

<p>
We pass to free a pointer to the block of memory
to deallocate.

<p>
If a piece of memory is not deallocated by <code>free</code> before the
program ends then usually the operating system in terminating the process
deallocates it.

<p>
By using <code>free</code> we can fix our program so that
it doesn't have any memory leaks. 

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="RunOutOfMemoryFixed.c"-->
</PRE>

What's the problem with this program now? Scroll down
when you know the answer.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

<p>
Now the program runs in an infinite loop.
<p>
Here is splint's output:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="RunOutOfMemoryFixed.splint"-->
</PRE>

<p>
Splint cannot detect that <code>malloc</code>
will never return NULL in this program
(there are limits to what static analysis can determine
only by looking at the source code).

<p>
On average Splint produces more false positives than false negatives,
since a programmer can often determine
quickly that Splint is producing
a spurious warning, but an unreported
warning could lead to a bug in the program. 

<h2>An example of dynamic memory allocation: Linked Lists</h2>
<p>
(Note: This linked list implementation is based on that 
found in
<A HREF="http://www-ee.eng.hawaii.edu/~alex/TextBooks/JoyOfC/info.html">
<i>The Joy of C</i></A> by Lawrence H. Miller, and
Alexander E. Quilici.)


<p>
An advantage of a linked list over an array is that
deleting or inserting elements in the middle of an array 
can be expensive since all the entries
must be shifted. A linked list requires no shifting
to insert or delete elements. 

<p>
But a linked list has the disadvantage
that it takes longer to retrieve an
entry. 

<p>
Here is the structure of a linked list:
<p>
<IMG SRC="LinkedList/LinkedList.gif">


<p>
Each node has two fields. One points to the
other node in the list, and the other 
holds the relevant data (in this case a name).

<p>
Let's implement a linked list which holds employee
records.

<p>
Since employees are always getting hired, and
fired a linked list is an appropriate data
structure for keeping the list in order
by employee last name. 

<p>
We will want to be able to insert to a list,
delete from a list, print out the list, or
find a employee record within the list. 

We start like this:
<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="LinkedList/Typedefs.c"-->
</PRE>

<p>
An <code>emp_record</code> has three data
fields corresponding to attributes of the employee,
and a <code>next</code> field which corresponds to the
next employee record in the list. 

<p>
We will define an <code>emp_list</code>
to be a pointer to an <code>emp_record</code>. 

<p>
And we will designate the empty list as
<code>NULL</code>:

<code><pre>
<!--#include virtual="LinkedList/emp_list_create.c"-->
</code></pre>

So we would write code like:

<pre><code>
emp_list my_list = emp_list_create();
</pre></code>

which just sets it to <code>NULL</code>.


<p>
First, let's write prototypes for all our functions, since
we want to insert, delete, find, and print we will need these
four functions:


<PRE><CODE>
emp_list insert_record(emp_list lst, emp_record *e);
emp_list delete_record(emp_list lst, char* lastname);
emp_record* find_record(emp_list lst, char* lastname);
void print_list(emp_list lst);
</PRE></CODE>

<p>
In the case of inserting or deleting we need to return a
new list. Remember that C all parameters are passed by
value so neither of these functions can actually modify
their argument, <code>lst</code>. That's why they need
to return the new changed list:

<pre><code>
my_list = delete_record(my_list, "Finkelstein");
</pre></code>


<p>
Before starting on that we need to implement
a simple function which copies one employee
record into another:

<pre><code>
<!--#include virtual="LinkedList/copy_record.c"-->
</pre></code>

<p>
We need to
do this because we are going to implement
<code>insert_record</code> by making
a copy of the record passed in. 

<p>
Our approach for <code>insert_record</code> will be to
iterate through the list looking for
the first entry whose last name is alphabetically
after the last name of the inserted record.
There are two cases
one for inserting to the front of the list, and the other
for inserting in the middle or the end:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="LinkedList/insert_record.c"-->
</PRE>

<p>
Here is a picture of what were doing if we insert 
"Cod" into an empty list:
<p>
<IMG SRC="LinkedList/LinkedListInsertEmpty.gif">
<p>

And here is a picture of what we are doing if we insert
"Cod" into a non-empty list:

<p>
<IMG SRC="LinkedList/LinkedListInsertFull.gif">
<p>

<p>
We have three more functions to implement:

<ul>
  <li><code>delete_record</code>
  <li><code>find_record</code>
  <li><code>print_list</code>
</ul>

However, <code>find_record</code>, and <code>print_list</code>
are both similar in that they involve interating through a list,
and performing some operations on each node.
Try and implement both of
those functions now. You can reuse the code which iterates
through the list from the <code>insert_record</code> function.
For now, just verify that it will compile. 

<p>
After you have finished writing those try doing <code>delete_record</code>.
As before with <code>insert_record</code> there are two cases: deleting
the first node in the list, and deleting the middle or last node. All
that is changed is that now
instead of setting the <code>next</code> pointer of the previous node
to the inserted record just set it to <code>next->next</code> node,
so that the deleted node no longer has another node in the list
pointing at it. Remember to <code>free</code> the deleted node.

<p>
After you have written the functions try them out using this
test bench.
<p>



<A HREF="LinkedList/test_bench.c.html">
Test Bench</a>

<p>
To run the test bench you will need the

<A HREF="LinkedList/emp_data.txt">
data file
</A>

to be
in the same directory as the program (be
careful about adding unneeded white space in the data
file)

<h2>Common Memory Errors</h2>

<p>
Splint can check unannotated programs for common types
of memory errors. Specifically a  memory leak and
a dangling pointer.


<h3>Memory Leak</h3>

A memory leak just means that there is some piece of memory that
has been allocated but there is no reference to it:
<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="MemoryLeak.c"-->
</PRE>

<p>
In this case the memory block which <code>ip</code>
was pointing at is unaccessible after the assignment

<PRE>
ip = ig;
</PRE>

<p>
Since there is no way to access it there is no way 
to <code>free</code> it. A small memory leak may be unnoticeable.
But if there is a function which gets executed over, and over
again, and for each execution there is a small memory leak, then
eventually the computer will run out of memory.

<p>
when we run Splint on this program we get:
<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="MemoryLeak.splint"-->
</PRE>


<h3>Dangling Pointer</h3>

<p>
Another type of error is called the "dangling pointer". The
problem occurs when a pointer is pointing at a piece of memory
that has already been <code>free</code>d. In this case, trying
to dereference that pointer will cause the program to crash.

<p>
Here is a simple example:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="DanglingPointer.c"-->
</PRE>


<p>
and what Splint has to say about it:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="DanglingPointer.splint"-->
</PRE>


<h2>Using Splint on the Linked List Program</h2>

<p>
Let's use Splint to find errors in the linked list
program.


We'll start with what we had from the previous section:

<ul>
  <li><A HREF=
       "LinkedList/LinkedList.c.html">LinkedList.c</A>

  <li><A HREF=
       "LinkedList/LinkedList.splint">LinkedList.splint</A>
</ul>
       <p>
       Splint reports 32 warnings.
       
       Let's look at the first warning:

       <pre><code>
       <!--#include virtual="LinkedList/LinkedList.warning"--> 
       </pre></code>

       Splint is raising this warning because it could be the case
       that <code>a->next</code> is pointing at a piece of memory in
       which case the line <code>a->next = b->next</code> would
       be a memory leak.

       <p>
       However, a pre-condition of this function is that <code>emp_record *a</code>
       is undefined (because we are overwriting its fields). We can tell
       Splint that we are going to make this assumption, and leave it up
       to the caller to prevent a possible memory leak. We can do this by adding
       an <code>/*@out@*/</code> annotation in <code>copy_record</code> telling
       Splint that  <code>emp_record *a</code> may be undefined:

<ul>
  <li><A HREF=
       "LinkedList/AddOut.c.html">AddOut.c</A>

  <li><A HREF="LinkedList/AddOut.splint">AddOut.splint</A>
</ul>

        <p>
        Now splint reports 30 warnings (with this extra information an additional
        warning was also eliminated).

        <p>
        Now let's look as this warning:

       <PRE><CODE>
       <!--#include virtual="LinkedList/AddOut.warning"-->
       </PRE></CODE>

        <p>
        Splint considers the possibility that <code>malloc</code> may have
        returned <code>NULL</code> in line 61 in which case a <code>NULL</code>
        pointer is getting passed to <code>copy_record</code>. We can fix
        the code by adding an <code>assert</code> statement.

        <pre><code>
        assert (new_record != NULL);
        </pre></code>

         <p>
         With the <code>assert</code> statement the program will abort if <code>malloc</code>
         returns NULL.
         
         <p>
          There are two other places in the file which have unchecked calls to
          <code>malloc</code>, lines 136, and 182. We fix these and get:

<ul>
  <li><A HREF="LinkedList/FixMalloc.c.html"> FixMalloc.c</A>

  <li><A HREF="LinkedList/FixMalloc.splint"> FixMalloc.splint </A>
</ul>

        <p>
        Now splint raises 27 warnings. Let's consider this warning:

        <code><pre>
       <!--#include virtual="LinkedList/FixMalloc.warning"-->
        </code></pre>

       Splint is raising a warning because it could be the case that
       <code>fp</code> is <code>NULL</code> because the call to <code>fopen</code>
       could have returned <code>NULL</CODE> if the file wasn't in the directory.
       We can fix this just like we fixed the <code>malloc</code> warnings, by
       adding an <code>assert</code> statement.


<ul>
  <li><A HREF="LinkedList/FixFgets.c.html">FixFgets.c</A>

  <li><A HREF="LinkedList/FixFgets.splint">FixFgets.splint</A>
</ul>

<p>
Now Splint raises 26 warnings. Let's consider the warning:

        <code><pre>
        <!--#include virtual="LinkedList/FixFgets.warning"-->
        </code></pre>

<p>
Since we are not going to use the return value of this function we'll
just cast the result to <code>void</code> and this will eliminate the
warning:


<ul>
  <li><A HREF="LinkedList/FixSscanf.c.html">FixSscanf.c</A>

  <li><A HREF="LinkedList/FixSscanf.splint">FixSscanf.splint</A>
</ul>

Now splint raises 25 warnings. 

<hr>
<p>
This gives you an idea of what kinds of warnings Splint
produces, and how the correct response may be to
change the code, or add an annotation. 


Some of the
warnings produced by Splint may be
spurious in which case
it is appropriate to use the <code>/*@i@*/</code>
annotation to suppress the checking of that line.

<p>
You can also suppress checking of a 
type of warning by unsetting the flag
when running Splint. For more information

Appendix B of the users guide</A>.

<!-- SCRAP HEAP


<h3>Passing Pointers to Stack Allocated Storage</h3>

<p>
Another less common type of error is letting a pointer
point at memory that has been allocated on the stack.
Since data on stack is deallocated when the function returns this is
a bad thing. For example, take a look at the following:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="StackAllocated.c"-->
</PRE>



<p>
The problem here is that the integer pointer <code>global</code>
gets the address of a piece of memory on the stack. But when the
function <code>f()</code> returns that piece of memory is deallocated,
so we have a "dangling" pointer.

<p>
Here is the output:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="StackAllocated.output"-->
</PRE>

<p>
Splint will warn you about this kind of problem:

<PRE>
<!--#include virtual="StackAllocated.splint"-->
</PRE>

-->
