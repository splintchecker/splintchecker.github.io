<h1>Types and Operations</h1> 

<h2>Overview</h2>
In this section we introduce 
the basics of the C language while also introducing
some of the common mistakes people make 
which are not caught by most compilers. We
show you how to use Splint to find these kinds of mistakes. 

<h2>Types</h2>
So far in the first C program we saw the <code> int </code> type. 
There are four other basic types in the C Programming
Language:
<code><pre>

char        defined to be a single byte holding one character
int         an integer
float       a single precision floating point number
double      a double precision floating point number

</code></pre>
<p>
An <code>int</code> is simply a positive or negative
whole number. A float, or double is a number
with a decimal point like 3.14159 or 2.71828.

<p>
You can declare variables of a certain type like this:

<code><pre>
int max = 50;
int a,b,c,d,e;   /*declare five integer types*/
float PI = 3.14159;
double E = 2.71828;
char language = 'C';  /*declare and initialize two character types*/
</code></pre>



<p>
The '=' sign is the 
<i> assignment </i> operator. The line: 
<code><pre>
int max = 50;
</code></pre>

<p>
means the variable <code>max</code> gets the value 50.

<p>
Notice we can either initialize the variable
when we declare it, or we may not.
What happens if 
we use a variable that we have not initialized? 
Try compiling and running
the following program: 


<code><pre>
<!--#include virtual="Initialized.c"-->
</code></pre>

Here the <code>%d</code> indicates that the
bits associated with variable <code>a</code> should
be interpreted as an integer in printing.  

What will this program output?
It should output the value 5 since variable <code>a
</code> was initialized with the value
5. 

What would happen if we didn't initialize the variable? 

<code><pre>
<!--#include virtual="Uninitialized.c"-->
</code></pre>

Try compiling and running the program, and see what happens. 
You should get something like: 

<code><pre>
dkf5k@paisley
: /uf5/dkf5k/testsource ; a.out
The value of variable a is -1073744252
</code></pre>

Where did this -1073744252 number come from? It
is whatever happens to be on the stack . In general, 
using a variable whose value is uninitialized is a bug. 
Notice that the compiler
silently produced an executable for you (even though the output is 
undefined, and the source code is probably wrong). 

<p>
Splint will tell you that something looks wrong.
Let's see how this works.

<p>
If you are using Emacs, create a new file (say <code> test.c </code>)
and, copy the above source code into it if you haven't done
so already. Then type <code> M-x compile </code> (the <code> 
M-x </code> should get you to the minibuffer then type 
<code> compile </code>). Now 
type <code> splint test.c </code>.  (you can 
also use the compilation buffer with <code> gcc </code> doing
straight compilation) 

<p>
If you are not using Emacs, your editor may have some similar 
feature to Emacs compilation buffer. Check your edtior documentation.
You can always run Splint from the command line, by using <code>
splint test.c </code>, and the output should scroll on your terminal 
window. (for this approach it would be best if you had a scrolling 
terminal window).

<p>
You should get output like this: 

<code><pre>
<!--#include virtual="Uninitialized.splint"-->
</code></pre>

<p>
(if Splint doesn't work, recheck the 
 <A HREF="http://www.splint.org/download.html">installation instructions
</A>)


<P>
Splint raised a "use before definition" 
warning, and this is what we should expect. We are using 
the variable <code> a </code> before it is defined. Typically in checking
a large source code file you would jump from warning to warning
comparing Splint's output to 
the source code.


<p>
An rvalue is any 
expression that can go on the right hand side of an assignment
statement. Numbers  like <code>3</code>, <code>5</code>,
<code>6</code>, are valid rvalues as are variables like <code>
Max</code>, <code>Min</code>, or <code>temp</code>. Lvalues
on the other hand are valid expressions that can go on the left
hand side of an assignment statement. Literal numbers
would not be valid lvalues since you can
not assign a value to a literal number. 

<p>
<!-- XXX: These should be presented better -->

Other things to be aware of: 

<ul> 
<li>Declarations
can only occur at the start of a program (or 
<i> function </i>). So code like this will not compile: 
<code><pre>
<!--#include virtual="InvalidDeclaration.c"-->
</code></pre>

<li>All variables must be valid C identifiers. The
rules for a variable to be a valid C identifier are the following: 

<ul>
<li>The first character must be a letter. 
<li>Subsequent characters may be either letters, digits, or
underscores.
<li>It must not be a C <A HREF="Keywords.html">keyword.</A>
</ul>

<p>
For a quick exercise determine which identifiers are valid, and which are not.


<ol>
<li><code> 1stPlace       </code>
<li><code> Float          </code>
<li><code> minVertex      </code>
<li><code> register       </code>
<li><code> best-match     </code>
<li><code> __maximum      </code>
<li><code> First&amp;Last </code>
<li><code> FirstBe4LLast  </code>
</ol>
</ul>

</ul>

<h2>Arithmetic Operations</h2>

In C there are five arithmetic operators: <code>+,-,*,/ </code>and the modulus
operator <code>%</code>. Usually you can use these just like you
would use a regular calculator but be aware of the following: 

<ul>
<li>The modulus operator for <code>a % b</code>
returns the remainder when a is divided by b.  e.g. <code>10 % 3</code>
will yield
1 because 10 divided by 3 equals 3 with a remainder of 1.

<br><br>
<li>There is a difference between floating point division and integer
division.  Note that <code> 11 / 2 </code>will not return the floating point
type <code>5.5 </code> but will return the integer type
<code>5</code>. If you want the <code> / </code> operator to instead
performing floating point division then do the following: add a
decimal point to either of the two operands e.g. <code> 11/2.0
</code>. (you can also do this was a <i> cast </i> as we will see in
the example)

     
<br><br>
<li>

Multiplication and division precede addition and subtraction
like in normal algebra. 
The expression <code> 3 * 4 + 2 * 7 </code> is
parenthesized as <code> (3 * 4) + (2 * 7) </code>.
</ul>
     

     
Let's look at an example of a common mistake programmers make using the
arithmetic operators, and show how Splint can find
this mistake.

Take a look at the following program:  
<pre><code>  
<!--#include virtual="DivisionMistake.c"-->
</pre></code>

Does this do the right thing? Try it and see, and then scroll down.

<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>


You should have got the output <code> 4
</code> instead of the output <code> 4.66667 </code>. This is because, 
as we mentioned above, since both <code>3</code> and <code> a + b + c
</code> are integers the compiler performs integer division 
instead of floating point division, and it truncated the result. This is not the same as rounding. The number
 4.666667 rounded is 5 not 4. The
compiler is saying is that  14 / 3  is equal to 4 with a remainder
of 2. 

Here is what Splint says about this program:

<pre><code> 
<!--#include virtual="DivisionMistake.splint"-->
</pre></code>

Splint says what is expected. In this line we
assigned an integer type to a floating point variable:
<pre><code>
float avg = (a + b + c) / 3;
</pre></code>

To fix this 
change the line to: 
<pre><code>   
float avg = (a + b + c) / 3.0;
</pre></code>
     
<p>
Here the compiler performs floating point division because at
least one of the operands is a floating point.



<h2> Logical Operations</h2>

The relational operations are

<code>&lt; &lt;= &gt; &gt;=</code>

These operators function as expected 
when applied to the numeric types <code> int, float
</code>
and <code> double </code>. The expression <code> 4 > 3</code> is true
     while the expression <code> 4 < 3</code> is false. In C:

<blockquote>
false is the numeric value zero, and true is any numeric value
other than zero.  
</blockquote>

To test for equality or inequality use
the relational equality or inequality operators,
==, and != respectively. These operators will always return 1 for
a true statement and 0 for a false one. 

The logical operators are:

<br><br><br>
<table border>
<caption>Logical Operators</caption>
<th>Operator <th>Name <tr>
<td><code>&&</code>       <td>AND  <tr>
<td><code>||</code>       <td>OR   <tr>
<td><code>! </code>       <td>NOT  
</table>
<br><br><br>

These function as one would expect. For example, here is the truth
table for the AND operator. 

<br><br><br>
<table border>
<caption>AND Operator</caption>
<th>A        <th>B       <th> A AND B <tr>
<td>True     <td>True    <td> True    <tr>
<td>True     <td>False   <td> False   <tr>
<td>False    <td>True    <td> False   <tr>
<td>False    <td>False   <td> False   
</table>
<br><br><br>

<h2>Characters and Strings</h2>
<p>
The <code> char </code> type represents a character. 
<p>

<code><pre>
char character = 'z';
</code></pre>

<p>
The following would print out the character:

<code><pre>
<!--#include virtual="PrintCharacter.c"-->
</code></pre>

<p>
In C an array holds a collection of the same type. The syntax
<code> char alphabet[26] </code> declares an array which holds
26 characters. The array is zero indexed so in this case
indices go from 0 to 25. We could write <code>alphabet[0] = 'a'
</code> or
<code>alphabet[25] = 'z'</code> to set characters in the array, and
<code>char TheLetterM = alphabet[12]</code> to get elements from the
array. 

<p>

In C we usually think of a string as an array of characters.
Here is how to define and print out a string:

<code><pre>
<!--#include virtual="PrintString.c"-->
</code></pre>


<p>
Notice that single quotes specify a character value, and
double quotes specify a string of zero or more characters.

<p>
The character array <code>TestString</code>
is 12 bytes long rather than
11 because an extra character is used at the end
for the NULL character ('\0') to specify
the end of the string. As an exercise try changing
the above 12 to an 11, and then run Splint on the code,
and see what the output is.

<p>
Here are some character constants you can play with: 
<br><br>
<table border>
<caption></caption>
<th>Character Name        <th>ASCII Name       <th>Escape Sequence <tr>
<td>newline                 <td>NL            <td>\n   <tr>
<td>horizontal tab          <td>HT            <td>\t   <tr>
<td>vertical tab            <td>VT            <td>\v   <tr>
<td>backspace               <td>BS            <td>\b   <tr>
<td>form feed               <td>FF            <td>\f   <tr>
<td>alert or bell           <td>BEL           <td>\a   <tr>
<td>carriage return         <td>CR            <td>\r   <tr>
<td>blackslash              <td>\             <td>\\   <tr>
<td>single quote            <td>'             <td>\'   <tr>
<td>dobule quote            <td>""             <td>\"   <tr>
<td>question mark           <td>?             <td>\?   <tr>
</table>
<br>

<p>
Try and write a program which rings the bell on the computer
(character constant \a).
