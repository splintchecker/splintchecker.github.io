        <p><a id="quest1" name="quest1">What is the difference between Splint and
        LCLint?</a></p>
        <p>Before 2002, Splint was known as LCLint. Splint 3.0 is the successor to LCLint
        2.5.</p>
        <blockquote>
          LCLint was originally named for LCL, the Larch C Interface Language and lint, a
          well-known C program checking tool. Because our tool has diverged from LCL, and
          our focus now is on secure programming, it was renamed Splint. Splint's name
          has (at least) three interpretations: specifications lint, secure programming
          lint, and first aid for programmers. It's also easier to pronounce than
          LCLint.<br />

        <p><a id="quest2" name="quest2">What is the Splint logo?</a></p>
        <blockquote>
          Thomas Jefferson's Serpentine Walls at the University of Virginia. The walls
          are one brick thick, but because of their design are both strong and aesthetic.
          Like a secure program, secure walls depend on sturdy bricks, solid
          construction, and elegant and principled design.<br />

        <p><a id="quest5" name="quest5">Does Splint handle C++?</a></p>
        <blockquote>
          No. Splint handles ISO C99 (and some gcc extensions if +gnuextensions is used).
          We don't have the resources (or the research justification) to build a C++
          front end, but if you are interested in building a C++ front end the source
          code is available, and I will certainly be willing to help.<br />

          For Win32, Splint looks for splint.rc instead of .splintrc due to the DOS

        <blockquote>
          One possibility is that the installation directory where the test suite is
          running is on the system path (hence, splint won't report errors if
          -sysdirerrors is set, as it is by default). Try adding +sysdirerrors to the
          command line for the test suite to see if that is the problem, or installing
          Splint in a different directory not in the system path.<br />

          <p>You can often use -D to solve this problem.</p>
          <p>If you just want to ignore a keyword, you can add -Dnonstandardkeyword= to
          make the preprocessor eliminate the keyword, where nonstandardkeyword is the
          name of the keyword. Similarly, you can use -Dspecialtype=int to make a custom
          type parse as an int.</p>

          There are lots of things that the C spec allows and defines clearly, that
          Splint will provide warnings for. It's not a question of it being "wrong", it's

          This is just a strategic decision --- we view ignoring the result of a scanf to
          be more likely to reveal a problem with the code than ignoring the result of a
