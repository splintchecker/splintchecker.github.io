LCLint <BR>
</h1>

LCLint is a lint-like tool for ANSI C.  It can be used like a traditional
lint to detect certain classes of C errors statically; if formal
specifications are also supplied, it can do more powerful checking to
detect inconsistencies between specifications and code.

<P>

Without specifications, LCLint does many of the checks done by a
traditional lint.  It reports unused declarations, type inconsistencies,
use-before-definition, unreachable code, ignored return values,
execution paths with no return, likely infinite loops, and fall-through
cases.  It provides options for stricter type-checking than standard C
(e.g., char and bool types can be treated as distinct from ints.).  It
does not do much of the portability checking (e.g., pointer alignment)
done by typical lints.

<P>

With partial specifications, written in the Larch interface language,
<A HREF="lcl.html">LCL</A>, LCLint does stronger checking.  For
example, a one-line specification file can declare a type as abstract;
LCLint checks that the data abstraction barrier is maintained in clients
of the type.  This provides the advantages of data encapsulation, making
programs easier to understand and maintain.

<P>

Adding more specifications enables further checking, including the
detection of:

<UL>

<LI> inconsistent use of global variables
<LI> undocumented modification of client-visible state
<LI> inconsistent use of an uninitialized formal parameter or failure to initialize an actual parameter
<LI> code with undefined behavior
<LI> macros specified as functions that do not behave functionally

</UL>

LCLint can be customized to a particular coding style using command line
flags.  Stylized comments may be used to suppress messages and control
checking at a local level.
