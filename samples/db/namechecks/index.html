<H3><A href="../../../guide/sec9.html">Naming Conventions</A></h3>

Now we check that the code conforms to a naming convention.  There is no
defined naming convention, so we will make one up that is close to what
the code already (almost) follows.

<h4> <A href="../../../guide/sec9.html#sec-9.1.1">Czech Names</a></h4>

The code most closely fits the Czech naming convention, where
identifiers are preceded by the associated type name followed by and
underscore. 

We use the <tt>+czech</tt> flag to select the Czech naming convention.
LCLint reports <A HREF="lclint.out.html">10 anomalies</A>.   

The first message reports a constant that does not follow the Czech
naming convention:
<pre>
<A HREF="eref.lcl.html#line7">eref.lcl:7,15</A>: Constant erefNIL name is not consistent with Czech naming
                  convention.  The name should begin with eref_
  Constant name is not consistent with Czech naming convention.  Use
  -czechconsts to suppress message.
</pre>
In fact, it follows the Slovak convention (<type><Name>).  We could use
the <tt>+slovakconstants</tt> flag to require that constants follow the
Slovak instead of the Czech naming convention.  Instead, we change the
name to <tt>eref_undefined</tt>.  After changing the declaration, we can
run lclint using <tt>+repeatunrecog</tt> to find all the places where
<tt>erefNIL</tt> appears and replace them with <tt>eref_undefined</tt>.
(Of course, if this were a larger system we would want to use emacs tags
and <tt>M-x tags-query-replace</tt> to do this more efficiently.)

The next six messages report function names that are inconsistent with
the Czech naming convention:
<pre>
< reading spec <A HREF="dbase.lcl.html">dbase.lcl</A> >
<A HREF="dbase.lcl.html#line17">dbase.lcl:17</A>: Function hire name is not consistent with Czech naming
                 convention.  Accessible types: db
  Function or iterator name is not consistent with Czech naming convention. 
  Use -czechfcns to suppress message.
<A HREF="dbase.lcl.html#line32">dbase.lcl:32</A>: Function uncheckedHire name is not consistent with Czech naming
                 convention.  Accessible types: db
<A HREF="dbase.lcl.html#line41">dbase.lcl:41</A>: Function fire name is not consistent with Czech naming
                 convention.  Accessible types: db
<A HREF="dbase.lcl.html#line49">dbase.lcl:49</A>: Function query name is not consistent with Czech naming
                 convention.  Accessible types: db
<A HREF="dbase.lcl.html#line57">dbase.lcl:57</A>: Function promote name is not consistent with Czech naming
                 convention.  Accessible types: db
<A HREF="dbase.lcl.html#line68">dbase.lcl:68</A>: Function setSalary name is not consistent with Czech naming
                 convention.  Accessible types: db
</pre>

The names are in the <tt>dbase</tt> module where the only accessible
type is the specification-only type <tt>db</tt>.  We add <tt>db_</tt> in
front of the names.
<p>

The other message is for <tt>check</tt>, which was added to <tt>bool.h</tt>:

<pre>
<A HREF="bool.h.html#line34">bool.h:34,29</A>: Function check name is not consistent with Czech naming
                 convention.  Accessible types: bool
</pre>

The <tt>check</tt> macro really does not belong in the <tt>bool</tt>
module.  In a real program, we would add a separate utilities file.
Here, we add a <tt>/*@noaccess@*/</tt> comment <A
HREF="bool-next.h.html#line34">before <tt>check</tt> is
declared</A>.  Since there are no accessible types now, <tt>check</tt>
is a valid function name.

<p>
The final two messages report type names that are inconsistent with the Czech
naming convention:
<pre>
<A HREF="eref.h.html#line9">eref.h:9,30</A>: Datatype eref_status name violates Czech naming convention.  Czech
                datatype names should not use the _ charater.
  Type name is not consistent with Czech naming convention.  Czech type names
  must not use the underscore character.  Use -czechtypes to suppress message.
<A HREF="eref.h.html#line14">eref.h:14,3</A>: Datatype eref_ERP name violates Czech naming convention.  Czech
                datatype names should not use the _ charater.
</pre>

Since the Czech prefix is distinguished by the underscore character,
names of types cannot use the underscore character.  The types are
renamed <tt>erefStatus</tt> and <tt>erefTable</tt>.

<h4> <A href="../../../guide/sec9.html#sec-9.3.2">Distinct Names</a> </h4>

LCLint can detect names that are not sufficiently different from other
names in the program.  This can be necessary to check portabilty to old
compilers that only use the first <em>n</em> characters of an
identifier.  It is also useful for the programmer, to reduce the
possiblity of using the wrong names.

Running LCLint using <tt>+distinctexternalnames</tt> produces <A
HREF="lclint-external.out.html">34 messages</a>.  The default number of
significant characters in an external name is 6, and alphabetic case is
not significant in comparisons.  (This is the minimum that is acceptable
in an ANSI conforming compiler.)
<p>
If we were really determined to have a program that is portable to old
systems, we should change these names to be different in the first six
characters.  (We would probably have to abandon the Czech naming
convention to do this.)  Instead, we use <tt>-externalnamelength
<em>n</em></tt> to find the minimum number of characters used in
comparisons.  We can try different values to see how many errors are
reported.  With <tt>-externalnamelength 12</tt>, <A
HREF="lclint-externallen.out.html">2 errors</a> are reported.  With
<tt>-externamelength 14</tt>, <A HREF="lclint-externallen14.out.html">no
errors</a> are reported.  
<p>
We haven't made the program any more portable,
but at least this is clearly documented now.  Someone trying to compile
the program in an environment where less than 14 characters are used for
external names, will need to edit the source code first.
<p>
Internal names can be checked similarly, except the default length is 31
characters.  We can use <tt>+internalnamelookalike</tt> to check that
names do not look the same (e.g., differ only in lookalike characters
like <tt>1</tt> and <tt>l</tt>.  Checking reports <a
href="lclint-internal.out.html">no errors</a>.

<h4> <a href="../../../guide/sec9.html#sec-9.2">Namespace Prefixes</a> </h4>

The Czech naming convention prescribes prefixes for names associated
with abstract types.  We can use specific namespace prefixes to restrict
other names, and place more restrictions on the abstract type names.  
<p>
One common convention is that names of expanded macros should use all
uppercase letters.  This is expressed by <tt>-uncheckedmacroprefix
"^~*"</tt>.  That is, an uppercase letter followed by one or more
non-lowercase letters.  Macros that implement functions or constants and
are checked by LCLint do not have to match the uncheckedmacroprefix,
since clients should not need to be aware that the implementation is a
macro.  One message reports a violation of this convention:
<pre>
</pre>
Since <tt>employeeFormat</tt> is preceeded by <tt>/*@notfunction@*/</tt>
it is expanded normally, and is in the unchecked macro namespace.  We
initially rename it to <tt>EMPLOYEEFORMAT</tt>.  This produces one new
message:
<pre>
employee.h:8: Name EMPLOYEEFORMAT is reserved for future ANSI library
    extensions. Macros beginning with E and a digit or uppercase letter may be
    added to <errno.h>. (See ANSI, Section 4.13.1)
  External name is reserved for system in ANSI standard.  Use -ansireserved to
  suppress message.
</pre>
Names beginning with <tt>E</tt> may be reserved for the ANSI library, so
we should use a different name.  It is changed to <tt>FORMATEMPLOYEE</tt>.
<p>
We might want to use a similar convention for enumerator members.  We
add <tt>-enumprefix "^^~*"</tt>.  This means an enumerator must start
with two capital letters, and the rest must be all non-lowercase
letters.  <A HREF="lclint-prefixes.out.html">Fourteen messages</A> report
violations of the enum prefix.  We fix these by changing the names to
use all capitals. 
<p>

<h4>Initialization File</h4>

Now, we move the name convention flags into an <A
HREF="../strictchecks/.lclintrc"><tt>.lclintrc</tt></A> file. The
<tt>.lclintrc</tt> file in the current directory is read before checking
begins.  If we wanted this naming convention to apply to code in other
directories too, we would put the flags in the <tt>.lclintrc</tt> file
in our home directory.
