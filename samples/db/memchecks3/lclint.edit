eref.c: (in function eref_initMod)
<A HREF="eref.c.html#line56">eref.c:56,14</A>: Global storage eref_Pool contains 2 undefined fields when call
                 returns: status, size

<A HREF="erc.c.html#line105">erc.c:105,5</A>: Arrow access from possibly null pointer prev: prev->next
  A possibly null pointer is dereferenced or misused.  Value is either the
  result of a function which may return null (in which case, code should check
  it is not null), or a global, parameter or structure field declared with the
  null qualifier.  Use -null to suppress message.
