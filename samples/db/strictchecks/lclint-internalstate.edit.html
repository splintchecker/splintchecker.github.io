<A HREF="eref.c.html#line63">eref.c:63,3</A>: Called procedure bool_initMod may access internal state, but
                globals list does not include globals internalState
  A called function uses internal state, but the globals list for the function
  being checked does not include internalState  Use -internalglobs to suppress
  message.
<A HREF="eref.c.html#line63">eref.c:63,3</A>: Undocumented modification of internal state possible from call to

  An externally-visible object is modified by a function, but not listed in its
  modifies clause.  Use -mods to suppress message.

  An externally-visible object is modified by a function with no /*@modifies@*/
  comment.  The /*@modifies ... @*/ control comment can be used to give a
  modifies list for an unspecified function.  Use -modnomods to suppress
  message.
