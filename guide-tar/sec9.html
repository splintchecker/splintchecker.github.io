9.  Naming Conventions
</a></h2>

Naming conventions tend to be a religious issue. Generally, it doesn't matter
too much what naming convention is followed as long as one is chosen and
followed religiously.  There are two kinds of naming conventions supported by
LCLint.  Type-based naming conventions (<a href="sec9.html#sec-9.1">Section 9.1</a>) constrain identifier names
according to the abstract types that are accessible where the identifier is
defined.  Prefix naming conventions (<a href="sec9.html#sec-9.2">Section 9.2</a>) constrain the initial
characters of identifier names according to what is being declared and its
scope.  Naming conventions may be combined or different conventions may be
selected for different kinds of identifiers.  In addition, LCLint supports
checking that names do not conflict with names reserved for the standard
library or implementation (<a href="sec9.html#sec-9.3">Section 9.3</a>) and that names are sufficiently
distinguishable from other names.

<a name="sec-9.1">9.1 Type-Based Naming Conventions</A></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Generic naming conventions constrain valid names of identifiers.  By limiting
valid names, namespaces may be preserved and programs may be more easily
understood since the name gives clues as to how and where the name is defined
and how it should be used.<p>
<p>
Names may be constrained by the scope of the name (external, file static,
internal), the file in which the identifier is defined, the type of the
identifier, and global constraints.

<blockquote>
<em>Of course, this is a complete jumble to the uninitiated, and that's the joke.</em><br>
- Charles Simonyi, on the Hungarian naming convention
</blockquote>
<p>
Czech<a href="guide_fn.html#fn23">[23]</a> names denote operations and variables
of abstract types by preceding the names by <i>&lt;type</i><i>&gt;</i>_.  The
remainder of the name should begin with a lowercase character, but may use any
other character besides the underscore.  Types may be named using any
non-underscore characters.   <p>
<p>
The Czech naming convention is selected by the czech flag.  If accessczech is
on, a function, variable, constant or iterator named
<i>&lt;type&gt;</i>_<i>&lt;name</i><i>&gt;</i> has access to the abstract type
<i>&lt;type&gt;</i>.<p>
<p>
Reporting of violations of the Czech naming convention is controlled by
different flags depending on what is being declared:<p>
<tt>czechfcns</tt>
<blockquote>
Functions and iterators.  An error is reported for a function name of the form
<i>&lt;prefix&gt;_&lt;name&gt;</i> where <i>&lt;prefix&gt;</i> is not the name
of an accessible type.  Note that if accessczech is on, a type named
<i>&lt;prefix&gt;</i> would be accessible in a function beginning with
<i>&lt;prefix&gt;_</i>.  If accessczech is off, an error is reported instead.
An error is reported for a function name that does not have an underscore if
any abstract types are accessible where the function is defined.
</blockquote>
<tt>czechvars</tt><br>
<tt>czechconstants</tt><br>
<tt>czechmacros</tt><br>
<blockquote>
Variables, constants and expanded macros.  An error is reported if the
identifier name starts with <i>&lt;prefix&gt;</i>_ and <i>prefix</i> is not the
name of an accessible abstract type, or if an abstract type is accessible and
the identifier name does not begin with <i>&lt;type&gt;_</i> where type is the
name of an accessible abstract type.  If accessczech is on, the representation
of the type is visible in the constant or variable definition.
</blockquote>
<tt>czechtypes</tt>
<blockquote>
User-defined types.  An error is reported if a type name includes an underscore
character.
</blockquote>
<h4>
<a name="sec-9.1.2">9.1.2 Slovak Names</A></a></a>
</a></h4>
Slovak names are similar to Czech names, except they are spelled differently.
A Slovak name is of the form <i>&lt;type&gt;&lt;Name&gt;</i>.  The type prefix
may not use uppercase characters.  The remainder of the name starts with the
first uppercase character.<p>
<p>
The slovak flag selects the Slovak naming convention.  Like Czech names, it may
be used with accessslovak to control access to abstract representations. The
slovakfcns, slovakvars, slovakconstants, and slovakmacros flags are analogous
to the similar Czech flags.  If slovaktype is on, an error is reported if a
type name includes an uppercase letter.

<a name="RTFToC68">
<a name="sec-9.1.3">9.1.3 Czechoslovak Names</A></a></a>
</a></h4>
Czechoslovak names are a combination of Czech names and Slovak names.
Operations may be named either <i>&lt;type</i><i>&gt;</i>_ followed by any
sequence of non-underscore characters, or <i>&lt;type&gt;</i> followed by an
uppercase letter and any sequence of characters.  Czechoslovak names have been
out of favor since 1993, but may be necessary for checking legacy code. The
czechoslovakfcns, czechoslovakvars, czechoslovakmacros, and
czechoslovakconstants flags are analogous to the similar Czech flags.  If
czechoslovaktype is on, an error is reported if a type name contains either an
uppercase letter or an underscore character.

<a name="sec-9.2">9.2 Namespace Prefixes</A></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Another way to restrict names is to constrain the leading character sequences
of various kinds of identifiers.  For example, a the names of all user-defined
types might begin with "T" followed by an uppercase letter and all file static
names begin with an uppercase letter.  This may be useful for enforcing a
namespace (e.g., all names exported by the X-windows library should begin with
"X") or just making programs easier to understand by establishing an enforced
convention.  LCLint can be used to constrain identifiers in this way to detect
identifiers inconsistent with prefixes.<p>
<p>
All namespace flags are of the form, -<i>&lt;context&gt;</i>prefix
<i>&lt;string&gt;</i>.  For example, the macro variable namespace restricting
identifiers declared in macro bodies to be preceded by "m_" would be selected
by -macrovarprefix "m_".  The string may contain regular characters that may
appear in a C identifier.  These must match the initial characters of the
identifier name.  In addition, special characters (shown in Table 1) can be
used to denoted a class of characters.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn24">[24]</a>  The
&#42; character may be used at the end of a prefix string to specify the
rest of the identifier is zero or more characters matching the character
immediately before the &#42;. For example, the prefix string "T&amp;&#42;"
matches "T" or "TWINDOW" but not "Twin".<p>

Different prefixes can be selected for the following identifier
contexts:<br>
<p> 
<tt>macrovarprefix</tt>
<blockquote> Any variable declared inside a macro body </blockquote>
<tt>uncheckedmacroprefix</tt>
<blockquote> Any macro that is not checked as a function or constant
(see <a href="sec8.html#sec-8.4">Section 8.4</a>)                 </blockquote>
<tt>tagprefix</tt>
<blockquote>Tags for struct, union and enum declarations  
</blockquote>
<tt>enumprefix</tt>
<blockquote>Members of enum types                         
</blockquote>
<tt>typeprefix</tt>
<blockquote>
Name of a user-defined type               
</blockquote>
<tt>filestaticprefix</tt>
<blockquote>Any identifier with file static scope</blockquote>
<tt>globvarprefix</tt>
<blockquote>
Any variable (not of function type) with global variables scope 
</blockquote>      
<tt>externalprefix</tt>
<blockquote>
Any exported identifier                       
</blockquote>
<p>
If an identifier is in more than one of the namespace contexts, the most specific
defined namespace prefix is used (e.g., a global variable is also an exported
identifier, so if globalvarprefix is set, it is checked against the variable
name; if not, the identifier is checked against the externalprefix.)<p>
<p>
For each prefix flag, a corresponding flag named
<i>&lt;prefixname&gt;</i>exclude controls  whether errors are reported if
identifiers in a different namespace match the namespace prefix.  For example,
if macrovarprefixexclude is on, LCLint checks that no identifier that is not a
variable declared inside a macro body uses the macro variable prefix. <p>
<p>
Here is a (somewhat draconian) sample naming convention:
<p>
<a href="appC.html#flag-uncheckedmacroprefix"><tt>-uncheckedmacroprefix "~&#42;"</tt></a><br>
       unchecked macros have no lowercase letters <br> <a
href="appC.html#flag-typeprefix"><tt>-typeprefix
"T^&amp;&#42;"</tt></a><br> all type typenames begin with T followed by an
uppercase letter.  The rest of the name is all lowercase letters.  <br>
<a
href="appC.html#flag-typeprefixexclude"><tt>+typeprefixexclude</tt></a><br>
no identifier that does not name a user-defined type may begin with the
type name prefix (set above) <br> <a
href="appC.html#flag-filestaticprefix"><tt>-filestaticprefix"^&amp;&amp;&amp;"</tt></a>
<br> file static scope variables begin with an uppercase letter and
three lowercase letters<br> <a
href="appC.html#flag-globvarprefix"><tt>-globvarprefix "G"</tt></a>
<br> all global variables variables start with G <br> <a
href="appC.html#flag-globvarprefixexclude"><tt>+globvarprefixexclude</tt></a><br>
no identifier that is not a global variable starts with G <p> <a

Naming Restrictions</A></a></a></a></a> </a></h2> Additional naming
restrictions can be used to check that names do no conflict with names
reserved for the standard library, and that identifier are sufficiently
distinct (either for the compiler and linker, or for the programmer.)
Restrictions may be different for names that are needed by the linker
(<i>external</i> names) and names that are only needed during
compilations (<i>internal</i> names).  Names of non-static functions and
global variables are external; all other names are internal.  <a
name="_Toc349905909"> <h4> <a name="RTFToC71"> <a name="sec-9.3.1">9.3.1
Reserved Names</A></a> </a></h4> Many names are reserved for the
implementation and standard library.  A complete list of reserved names
can
be
found in [<a href="references.html#ref-vdL">vdL</A>, p. 126-128] or [<a href="guide.html#ref-ANSI">ANSI</A>, <a
href="sec4.html">Section 4</a>].  Some name prefixes such as str
followed by a lowercase character are reserved for future library
extensions.  Most C compilers do not detect naming conflicts, and they
can lead to unpredictable program behavior.  If ansireserved is on,
LCLint reports errors for external names that conflict with reserved
names.  If ansireservedinternal is on, errors are also reported for
internal names.  <a name="_Toc349905910"> <h4> <a name="RTFToC72"> <a
name="sec-9.3.2">9.3.2 Distinct Identifiers</A></a> </a></h4>
<blockquote> <em>The decision to retain the old six-character
case-insensitive restriction on significance was most painful.</em><br>
- ANSI C Rationale </blockquote> <p> LCLint can check that identifiers
differ within a given number of characters, optionally ignoring
alphabetic case and differences between characters that look similar.
The number of significant characters may be different for external and
internal names.  <p> <p> Using <a
href="appC.html#flag-distinctexternalnames"><tt>+distinctexternalnames</tt></a>
sets the number of significant characters for external names to six and
makes alphabetical case insignificant for external names.  This is the
minimum significance acceptable in an ANSI-conforming compiler.  Most
modern compilers exceed these minimums (which are particularly hard to
follow if one uses the Czech or Slovak naming convention).  The number
of significant characters can be changed using the externalnamelength
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i> flag.  If externalnamecaseinsensitive is on,
alphabetical case is ignored in comparing external names. LCLint reports
identifiers that differ only in alphabetic case. <p> <p> For internal
identifiers, a conforming compiler must recognize at least 31 characters
and treat alphabetical cases distinctly.  Nevertheless, it may still be
useful to check that internal names are more distinct then required by
the compiler to minimize the likelihood that identifiers are confused in
the program.  Analogously to external names, the internalnamelength
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i> flag sets the number of significant characters in
an internal name and internalnamecaseinsensitive sets the case
sensitivity.  The internalnamelookalike flag further restricts
distinctions between identifiers.  When set, similar-looking characters
match -- the lowercase letter "l" matches the uppercase letter "I" and
the number "1"; the letter "O" or "o" matches the number "0"; "5"
matches "S"; and "2" matches "Z".  Identifiers that are not distinct
except for look-alike characters will produce an error message.
External names are also internal names, so they must satisfy both the
external and internal distinct identifier checks.<p> <p> <a
