<h2>Appendix E  Control Comments</h2></a></a>

<b><i>Error Suppression</a></a></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Several comments are provided for suppressing messages.  In
general, it is usually better to use specific flags to suppress a particular
error permanently, but the general error suppression flags may be more
convenient for quickly suppressing messages for code that will be corrected or
documented later.<p>
<tt>ignore</tt><br>
<tt>end</tt>
<blockquote>
No errors will be reported in code regions between <tt>/&#42;@ignore@*/</tt>
and <tt>/&#42;@end@*/</tt>. These comments can be used to easily suppress an
unlimited number of messages, but are dangerous since if real errors are
introduced in the <tt>ignore ... end</tt> region they will not be
reported. The ignore and end comments must be matched - a warning is
printed if the file ends in an ignore region or if ignore is used inside
ignore region.
</blockquote>
<tt>i</tt><br>
<blockquote>
No errors will be reported from an <tt>/&#42;@i@*/</tt> comment to the end of the line.<p>
</blockquote>
<tt>i</tt><i>&lt;n&gt;</i><br>
<blockquote>
 No errors will be reported from an /&#42;@i<i>&lt;n&gt;</i>@*/ (e.g.,
<tt>/&#42;@i3@*/</tt>) comment to the end of the line. If there are not
exactly <i>n </i>errors suppressed from the comment point to the end of
the line, LCLint will report an error.  This is more robust than i or
ignore since a message is generated if the expected number errors is not
present.  Since errors are not necessarily detected until after this
file is processed (for example, and unused variable error), suppress
count errors are reported after all files have been processed. The <a
href="appC.html#flag-supcounts"><tt>-supcounts</tt></a> flag may be
used to suppress these errors.  This is useful when a system if being
rechecked with different flag settings.  
</blockquote>
<tt>t</tt><br>
<tt>t</tt><i>&lt;n&gt;</i><br>
<blockquote>
Like <tt>i</tt> and <tt>i</tt><i>&lt;n&gt;</i>, except controlled by
<tt>+tmpcomments</tt> flag.  These can be used to temporarily suppress
certain errors.  Then, <tt>-tmpcomments</tt> can be set to find them
again.
</blockquote>
<p>
<b><i>Type Access</i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Control comments may also be used to override type access
settings. The syntax <tt>/&#42;@access </tt><i>&lt;type&gt;</i>,+<tt>@*/</tt> allows the following code to
access the representation of <i>&lt;type&gt;</i>.  Similarly,
<tt>/&#42;@noaccess </tt><i>&lt;type&gt;</i>,+<tt>@*/</tt> restricts access
to the representation of <i>&lt;type&gt;</i>.  The type in a noaccess
comment must have been declared as an abstract type.  Type access
applies from the point of the comment to the end of the file or the next
access control comment for this type. 
<a name="_Toc349905962"><p>
<b><i>Macro Expansion</a></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>The <tt>/&#42;@notfunction@*/</tt>indicates that the next macro definition is
not intended to be a function, and should be expanded in line instead of
checked as a macro function definition.
<a name="_Ref347471625"><a name="_Toc349905963"><p>
<b><i>Traditional Lint Comments</a></a></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>Some of the control comments supported by most standard UNIX
lints are supported by LCLint so legacy systems can be checked more easily.
These comments are not lexically consistent with LCLint comments, and their
meanings are less precise (and may vary between different lint programs), so we
recommend that LCLint comments are used instead except for checking legacy
systems already containing standard lint comments.<p>
<p>
These standard lint comments supported by LCLint:<p>
<tt>/&#42;FALLTHROUGH*/</tt> (alternate misspelling, <tt>/&#42;FALLTHRU*/</tt>)
<blockquote>
Prevents errors for fall-through cases.  Same meaning as <tt>/&#42;@fallthrough@*/</tt>.
</blockquote>
<tt>/&#42;NOTREACHED*/</tt>
<blockquote>
Prevents errors about unreachable code (until the end of the function).  Same
meaning as <tt>/&#42;@notreached@*/</tt>.  
</blockquote>
<tt>/&#42;PRINTFLIKE*/</tt>
<blockquote>
Arguments similar to the printf library function (there didn't seem to be much
of a consensus among standard lints as to exactly what this means).  LCLint
supports:
<p>
<tt>/&#42;@printflike@*/</tt>
<blockquote>
Function takes zero or more arguments of any type, an unmodified char * format
string argument and zero of more arguments of type and number dictated by the
format string.  Format codes are interpreted identically to the printf standard
library function.  May return a result of any type.  (LCLint interprets
<tt>/&#42;PRINTFLIKE*/</tt> as <tt>/&#42;@printflike@*/</tt>.)<p>
</blockquote>
<tt>/&#42;@scanflike@*/</tt>
<blockquote>
Like printflike, except format codes are interpreted as in the scanf library
function.
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<tt>/&#42;ARGSUSED*/</tt>
<blockquote>
Turns off unused parameter messages for this function.  The control
comment, <tt>/&#42;@-paramuse@*/</tt> can be used to the same effect, or
<tt>/&#42;@unused@*/</tt> can be used in individual parameter declarations.
</blockquote>
<p>
LCLint will ignore standard lint comments if <a
href="appC.html#flag-lintcomments"><tt>-lintcomments</tt></a> is used.
If <a
href="appC.html#flag-warnlintcomments"><tt>+warnlintcomments</tt></a>
is used, LCLint generates a message for standard lint comments and suggest replacements,
