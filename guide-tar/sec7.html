7. Value Constraints
</a></h2>
LCLint can be used to constrain values of parameters, function results, global
variables, and derived storage such as structure fields.  These constraints are
checked at <i>interface points</i> -- where a function is called or returns.
<a href="sec7.html#sec-7.1">Section 7.1</a> describes how to constrain parameters, return values and structures
to detect use before definition errors.  A similar approach is used for
restricting the use of possibly null pointers in <a
href="sec7.html#sec-7.2">Section 7.2.</a>  To do both well, and avoid spurious errors, information about when and if a function returns if
useful.  Annotations for documenting execution control are described in
<a href="sec7.html#sec-7.3">Section 7.3</a>.<p>
<p>

<a name="RTFToC45">
<a name="sec-7.1">7.1 Use Before Definition</A></a></a>
</a></h2>
Like many static checkers, LCLint detects instances where the value of a
location is used before it is defined.  This analysis is done at the procedural
level.  If there is a path through the procedure that  <p>
uses a local variable before it is defined, a use before definition error is
reported.  Use before definition checking is controlled by the <a href="appC.html#flag-usedef"><tt>usedef</tt></a> flag.<p>
<p>
LCLint can do more checking than standard checkers though, because the
annotations can be used to describe what storage must be defined and what
storage may be undefined at interface points. Unannotated references are
expected to be completely defined at interface points.  This means all storage
reachable from a global variable, parameter to a function, or function return
value is defined before and after a function call.

<a name="RTFToC46">
<a name="sec-7.1.1">7.1.1 Undefined Parameters</A></a></a></a>
</a></h3>
Sometimes, function parameters or return values are expected to reference
undefined or partially defined storage.  For example, a pointer parameter may
be intended only as an address to store a result, or a memory allocator may
return allocated but undefined storage.  The <tt>out</tt> annotation denotes a pointer
to storage that may be undefined.<p>
<p>
LCLint does not report an error when a pointer to allocated but undefined
storage is passed as an <tt>out</tt> parameter.  Within the body of a function, LCLint
will assume an <tt>out</tt> parameter is allocated but not necessarily bound to a value,
so an error is reported if its value is used before it is defined.  <p>
<p>
LCLint reports an error if storage reachable by the caller after the call is
not defined when the function returns.  This can be suppressed by <a href="appC.html#flag-mustdefine"><tt>-mustdefine</tt></a>.
When checking a call, an actual parameter corresponding to an <tt>out</tt> parameter is
assumed to be completely defined after the call returns.<p>
<p>
When checking unannotated programs, many spurious use before definition errors
may be reported   If <a href="appC.html#flag-impouts"><tt>impouts</tt></a> is on, no error is reported when an
incompletely-defined parameter is passed to a formal parameter with no
definition annotation, and the actual parameter is assumed to be defined after
the call.  The <tt>/&#42;@in@&#42;/</tt> annotation can be used to denote a parameter that must
be completely defined, even if impouts is on.  If impouts is off, there is an
implicit in annotation on every parameter with no definition annotation.

</a></h3>
The reldef annotation relaxes definition checking for a particular declaration.
Storage declared with a reldef annotation is assumed to be defined when it is
used, but no error is reported if it is not defined before it is returned or
passed as a parameter.<p>
<p>
It is up to the programmer to check reldef fields are used correctly.   They
should be avoided in most cases, but may be useful for fields of structures
that may or may not be defined depending on other constraints.

<a name="sec-7.1.3">7.1.3 Partially Defined Structures</A></a></a>
</a></h3>
The partial annotated can be used to relax checking of structure fields.  A
structure with undefined fields may be passed as a partial parameter or
returned as a partial result.  Inside a function body, no error is reported
when the field of a partial structure is used.  After a call, all fields of a
structure that is passed as a partial parameter are assumed to be completely
defined.<p>

<a name="sec-7.1.4">7.1.4 Global Variables</A></a></a>
</a></h3>
Special annotations can be used in the globals list of a function declaration
(<a href="sec4.html#sec-4.2">Section 4.2</a>) to describe the states of global variables before and after the
call.<p>
<p>
If a global is preceded by undef, it is assumed to be undefined before the
call. Thus, no error is reported if the global is not defined when the function
is called, but an error is reported if the global is used in the function body
before it is defined.<p>
<p>
The killed annotation denotes a global variable that may be undefined when the
call returns.  For globals that contain dynamically allocated storage, a killed
global variable is similar to an only parameter (<a href="sec5.html#sec-5.2">Section 5.2</a>).  An error is
reported if it contains the only reference to storage that is not released
before the call returns.<p>

<a name="RTFToC50">
<a name="sec-7.2">7.2 Null Pointers</A></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
A common cause of program failures is when a null pointer is dereferenced.
LCLint detects these errors by distinguishing possibly NULL pointers at
interface boundaries.<p>
<p>
The null annotation is used to indicate that a pointer value may be NULL.  A
pointer declared with no null annotation, may not be NULL.  If null checking is
turned on (controlled by null), LCLint will report an error when a possibly
null pointer is passed as a parameter, returned as a result, or assigned to an
external reference with no null qualifier.<p>
<p>
If a pointer is declared with the null annotation, the code must check that it
is not NULL on all paths leading to the a dereference of the pointer (or the
pointer being returned or passed as a value with no null annotation).
Dereferences of possibly null pointers may be protected by conditional
statements or assertions (to see how assert is declared see <a href="sec7.html#sec-7.3">Section 7.3</a>) that
check the pointer is not NULL.<p>
<p>
Consider two implementations of firstChar in <a href="fig15.html">Figure 15</a>. For firstChar1, LCLint
reports an error since the pointer that is dereferenced is declared with a null
annotation.  For firstChar2, no error is reported since the true branch of the
s == NULL if statement returns, so the dereference of s is only reached if s is
not NULL.<p>
<h3>
<a name="RTFToC51">
<a name="sec-7.2.1">7.2.1 Predicate Functions</A></a></a>
</a></h3>
Another way to protect null dereference, is to declare a function using
falsenull or truenull and call the function in a conditional statement before
the null-annotated pointer is dereferenced.  The falsenull and truenull
annotations may only be used on return values for functions that return a
boolean<a href="guide_fn.html#fn19">[19]</a> result and whose first argument is
a possibly null pointer.<p>
<p>
A function is annotated with <tt>truenull</tt> is assumed to return TRUE if its first
parameter is NULL and FALSE otherwise. For example, if isNull is declared as,
<pre>
   /&#42;@truenull@&#42;/ bool isNull (/&#42;@null@&#42;/ char &#42;x);
</pre>
we could write firstChar2:
<pre>
   char firstChar2 (/&#42;@null@&#42;/ char &#42;s)
   {
      if (isNull (s)) return '\0';
      return &#42;s;
   }
</pre>
No error is reported since the dereference of s is only reached if isNull(s) is
false, and since isNull is declared with the truenull annotation this means s
must not be null.<p>
<p>
The <tt>falsenull</tt> annotation is not quite the opposite of truenull.  If a function
declared with falsenull returns TRUE, it means its parameter is not NULL.  If
it returns FALSE, the parameter may or may not be NULL.<p>
<p>
For example, we could define isNonEmpty to return TRUE if its parameter is not
NULL and has least one character before the NUL terminator:
<pre>
   /&#42;@falsenull@&#42;/ bool isNonEmpty (/&#42;@null@&#42;/ char &#42;x)
   {
     return (x != NULL &amp;&amp; &#42;x != `\0');
   }
</pre>
LCLint does not check that the implementation of a function declared with
falsenull or truenull is consistent with its annotation, but assumes the
annotation is correct when code that calls the function is checked.

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC52">
<a name="sec-7.2.2">7.2.2 Overriding Null Types</A></a>
</a></h3>
The null annotation may be used in a type definition to indicate that all
instances of the type may be NULL.  For declarations of a type declared using
null, the null annotation in the type definition may be overridden with
notnull. This is particularly useful for parameters to hidden static operations
of abstract types where the null test has already been done before the function
is called, or function results of the type which are never NULL.  For an
abstract type, notnull may not be used for parameters to external functions,
since clients should not be aware of when the concrete representation may by
NULL.  Parameters to static functions in the implementation module, however,
may be declared using notnull, since they may only be called from places where
the representation is accessible.  Return values for static or external
functions may be declared using notnull. <p>

<h3>
<a name="RTFToC53">
<a name="sec-7.2.3">7.2.3 Relaxing Null Checking</A></a></a>
</a></h3>
An additional annotation, relnull may be used to relax null checking (relnull
is analogous to reldef for definition checking).  No error is reported when a
relnull value is dereferenced, or when a possibly null value is assigned to an
identifier declared using relnull. <p>
<p>
This is generally used for structure fields that may or may not be null
depending on some other constraint.  LCLint does not report and error when NULL
is assigned to a relnull reference, or when a relnull reference is
dereferenced.  It is up to the programmer to ensure that this constraint is
satisfied before the pointer is dereferenced.

<h2>
<a name="RTFToC54">
<a name="sec-7.3">7.3 Execution</A></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
To detect certain errors and avoid spurious errors, it is important to know
something about the control flow behavior of called functions. Without
additional information, LCLint assumes that all functions eventually return and
execution continues normally at the call site.  <p>
<p>
The exits annotation is used to denote a function that never returns.  For
example,
<pre>
extern /&#42;@exits@&#42;/ void fatalerror (/&#42;@observer@&#42;/ char &#42;s);
</pre>
declares fatalerror to never return.  This allows LCLint to correctly analyze
code like,
<pre>
   if (x == NULL) fatalerror ("Yikes!");
   &#42;x = 3;
</pre>
Other functions may exit, but sometimes (or usually) return normally.  The
mayexit annotation denotes a function that may or may not return.  This doesn't
help checking much, since LCLint must assume that a function declared with
mayexit returns normally when checking the code.<p>
<p>
To be more precise, the trueexit and falseexit annotations may be used
Similar to truenull and falsenull (see <a href="sec7.html#sec-7.2.1">Section 7.2.1</a>), trueexit and falseexit
mean that a function always exits if the value of its first argument is TRUE or
FALSE respectively.  They may be used only on functions whose first argument
has a boolean type.  <p>
<p>
A function declared with trueexit must exit if the value of its argument is
TRUE, and a function declared with falseexit must exit if the value of its
argument is FALSE.  For example, the standard library declares assert as<a
href="guide_fn.html#fn20">[20]</a>:</a><p><pre>
/&#42;@falseexit@&#42;/ void assert (/&#42;@sef@&#42;/ bool /&#42;@alt int@&#42;/ pred);
</pre>
This way, code like,
<pre>
   assert (x != NULL);<p>
   &#42;x = 3;
</pre>
is checked correctly, since the falseexit annotation on assert means the
deference of x is not reached is x != NULL is false.

<h2>
<a name="sec-7.4">7.4 Special Clauses
</a></h2>

Sometimes it is necessary to specify function interfaces at a lower
level than is possible with the standard annotations.  For example, if a
function defines some fields of a returned structure but does not define
all the fields.  The <tt>/&#42;@special@&#42;/</tt> annotation is used to mark a
parameter, global variable, or return value that is described using
special clauses.  The usual implicit definition rules do not apply to a
special declaration.
<p>
Special clauses may be used to constrain the state of a parameter or
return value before or after a call.  One or more special clauses may
appear in a function declaration, before the modifies or globals
clauses.  Special clauses may be listed in any order, but the same
special clause should not be used more than once.  Parameters used in
special clauses must be annotated with <tt>/&#42;@special@&#42;/</tt> in the function
header.  In a special clause list, result is used to refer to the return
value of the function.  If result appears in a special clause, the
function return value must be annotated with <tt>/&#42;@special@&#42;/</tt>.
<p>
The following special clauses are used to describe the definition state
or parameters before and after the function is called and the return
value after the function returns:
<p>

<tt>/&#42;@uses </tt><em>references</em><tt>@&#42;/</tt> 
<blockquote>
References in the uses clause must be completely defined before the
function is called.  They are assumed to be defined at function entrance
when the function is checked.
</blockquote>

<tt>/&#42;@sets </tt><em>references</em><tt>@&#42;/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the sets clause must be allocated before the function is
called.  They are completely defined after the function returns. When
the function is checked, they are assumed to be allocated at function
entrance and an error is reported if there is a path on which they are
not defined before the function returns.
</blockquote>

<tt>/&#42;@defines </tt><em>references</em><tt>@&#42;/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the defines clause must not refer to unshared, allocated
storage before the function is called.  They are completely defined
after the function returns. When the function is checked, they are
assumed to be undefined at function entrance and an error is reported if
there is a path on which they are not defined before the function
returns.
</blockquote>

<tt>/&#42;@allocates </tt><em>references</em><tt>@&#42;/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the allocates clause must not refer to unshared, allocated
storage before the function is called.  They are allocated but not
necessarily defined after the function returns. When the function is
checked, they are assumed to be undefined at function entrance and an
error is reported if there is a path on which they are not allocated
before the function returns.
</blockquote>

<tt>/&#42;@releases </tt><em>references</em><tt>@&#42;/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the releases clause are deallocated by the function.  They
must correspond to storage which could be passed as an only parameter
before the function is called, and are dead pointers after the function
returns.  When the function is checked, they are assumed to be allocated
at function entrance and an error is reported if they refer to live,
allocated storage at any return point.
</blockquote>
<p>

Additional generic special clauses can be used to describe other aspects
of the state of inner storage before or after a call.  Generic special
clauses have the form <em>state</em><tt>:</tt><em>constraint</em>.  The
state is either <tt>pre</tt> (before the function is called), or
<tt>post</tt> (after the function is called).  The constraint is similar
to an annotation.  The following constraints are supported:

<blockquote>
<h4>Aliasing Annotations</h4>

<tt>pre:only</tt>, <tt>post:only</tt><br>
<tt>pre:shared</tt>, <tt>post:shared</tt><br>
<tt>pre:owned</tt>, <tt>post:owned</tt><br>
<tt>pre:dependent</tt>, <tt>post:dependent</tt><br>
<blockquote>
References refer to <tt>only</tt>, <tt>shared</tt>, <tt>owned</tt> or
<tt>dependent</tt> storage before (<tt>pre</tt>) or after
(<tt>post</tt>) the call.
</blockquote>

<h4>Exposure Annotations</h4>

<tt>pre:observer</tt>, <tt>post:observer</tt><br>
<tt>pre:exposed</tt>, <tt>post:exposed</tt><br>
<blockquote>

References refer to <tt>observer</tt> or <tt>exposed</tt> storage before
(<tt>pre</tt>) or after (<tt>post</tt>) the call.

</blockquote>

<h4>Null State Annotations</h4>

<tt>pre:isnull</tt>, <tt>post:isnull</tt>
<blockquote>
References have the value <tt>NULL</tt> before (<tt>pre</tt>) or after
(<tt>post</tt>) the call. Note, this is not the same name or meaning as
the null annotation (which means the value may be <tt>NULL</tt>.)  
</blockquote>
<tt>pre:notnull</tt>, <tt>post:notnull</tt>
<blockquote>
References do not have the value <tt>NULL</tt> before (<tt>pre</tt>) or
after (<tt>post</tt>) the call. 
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Some examples of special clauses are shown in <a
href="fig17.html">Figure 17</a>. The defines clause for
<tt>record_new</tt> indicates that the <tt>id</tt> field of the
structure pointed to by the result is defined, but the <tt>name</tt>
field is not.  So, <tt>record_create</tt> needs to call
<tt>record_setName</tt> to define the <tt>name</tt> field.  Similarly,
the releases clause for <tt>record_clearName</tt> indicates that no
storage is associated with the <tt>name</tt> field of its parameter
after the return, so no failure to deallocate storage message is
produced for the call to <tt>free</tt> in <tt>record_free</tt>.
