<p>
Information hiding is a technique for handling complexity.  By hiding
implementation details, programs can be understood and developed in distinct
modules and the effects of a change can be localized.  One technique for
information hiding is data abstraction.  An abstract type is used to represent
some natural program abstraction.  It provides functions for manipulating
instances of the type.  The module that implements these functions is called
the <i>implementation</i> module.  We call the functions that are part of the
implementation of an abstract type the <i>operations</i> of the type.  Other
modules that use the abstract type are called <i>clients</i>.<p>
<p>
Clients may use the type name and operations, but should not manipulate or rely
on the actual representation of the type.  Only the implementation module may
manipulate the representation of an abstract type.  This hides information,
since implementers and maintainers of client modules should not need to know
anything about how the abstract type is implemented. It provides modularity,
since the representation of an abstract type can be changed without having to
change any client code.<p>
<p>
LCLint supports abstract types by detecting places where client code depends on
the concrete representation of an abstract type.  <p>
To declare an abstract type, the abstract annotation is added to a typedef.
For example (in <tt>mstring.h</tt>),
<pre>
typedef /&#42;@abstract@&#42;/ char &#42;mstring;
</pre>
declares <tt>mstring</tt> as an abstract type.  It is implemented using a <tt>char &#42;</tt>, but
clients of the type should not depend on or need to be aware of this.  If it
later becomes apparent that a better representation such as a string table
should be used, we should be able to change the implementation of mstring
without having to change or inspect any client code.<p>
<p>
In a client module, abstract types are checked by name, not structure.  LCLint
reports an error if an instance of mstring is passed as a char &#42; (for instance,
as an argument to strlen), since the correctness of this call depends on the
representation of the abstract type.  LCLint also reports errors if any C
operator except assignment (=) or sizeof is used on an abstract type.  The
assignment operator is allowed since its semantics do not depend on the
representation of the type.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn4">[4]</a>

The use of <tt>sizeof</tt> is also permitted, since this is the only way for clients
to allocate pointers to the abstract type.  Type casting objects to or from
abstract types in a client module is an abstraction violation and will generate
a warning message.</a><p>
<p>
Normally, LCLint will assume a type definition is not abstract unless the
<tt>/&#42;@abstract@&#42;/</tt> qualifier is used.  If instead you want all user-defined types
to be abstract types unless they are marked as concrete, the <a href="appC.html#flag-impabstract"><tt>+impabstract</tt></a> flag
can be used.  This adds an implicit abstract annotation to any typedef that is
not marked with <tt>/&#42;@concrete@&#42;/</tt>.<p>
<p>
Some examples of abstraction violations detected by LCLint are shown in
<a href="fig2.html">Figure 2</a>.<p>

<a name="RTFToC9">
<a name="sec-3.1">3.1 Access</A></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Where code may manipulate the representation of an abstract type, we say the
code has <i>access</i> to that type.  If code has access to an abstract type,
the representation of the type and the abstract type are indistinguishable.
Usually, an abstract type is implemented by a single program module that is the
only code that has access to the type representation.  Sometimes, more
complicated access control is desired if the implementation of an abstract type
is split across program files, or particular client code needs to access the
representation.<p>
<p>
There are a several ways of selecting what code has access the representation
of an abstract type:<p>
<ul>
<li>	Modules.  An abstract type defined in <i>M</i>.h is accessible in
<i>M</i>.c.  Controlled by the accessmodule flag.  This means when accessmodule
is on, as it is by default, the module access rule is in effect.  If
accessmodule is off (when <a href="appC.html#flag-accessmodule"><tt>-accessmodule</tt></a> is used), the module access rule is not
in effect and an abstract type defined in <i>M</i>.h is not necessarily
accessible in <i>M</i>.c<p>
<li>	File names.  An abstract type named <i>type</i> is accessible in files
named <i>type</i>.<i>&lt;extenstion&gt;</i>.  For example, the representation
of mstring is be accessible in mstring.h and mstring.c.  Controlled by the
<a href="appC.html#flag-accessfile"><tt>accessfile</tt></a> flag.<p>
<li>	Function names.  An abstract type named <i>type</i> may be accessible in
a function named <i>type</i>_<i>name</i> or <i>typeName</i>.  For example,
mstring_length and mstringLength would have access to the mstring abstract
type.  Controlled by the naming convention (see <a
href="sec9.html">Section 9</a>).<p>
<li>	Access control comments. The syntax /&#42;@access <i>type</i>,+@&#42;/<a
href="guide_fn.html#fn6">[6]</a> allows the following code to access the
representation of <i>type</i>.  Similarly, /&#42;@noaccess <i>type</i>,+@&#42;/
restricts access to the representation of <i>type</i>.  The type in a noaccess
comment must have been declared as an abstract type.

<a name="RTFToC10">
<a name="sec-3.2">3.2 Mutability</A></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
We can view types as being <i>mutable</i> or <i>immutable</i>.  A type is
mutable if the value of an instance of the type can be changed by passing it as
a parameter to a function call.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn7">[7]</a>  For example, the
primitive type <tt>int</tt> is immutable.  If i is a local variable of type int and
no variables point to the location where i is stored, the value of i must be
the same before and after the call f(i).  Structure and union types are also
immutable, since they are copied when they are passed as arguments.  On the
other hand, pointer types are mutable.  If x is a local variable of type int &#42;,
the value of &#42;x (and hence, the value of the object x) can be changed by the
function call g(x).  <p>
<p>
The mutability of a concrete type is determined by its type definition. For
abstract types, mutability does not depend on the type representation but on
what operations the type provides. If an abstract type has operations that may
change the value of instances of the type, the type is mutable.  If not, it is
immutable.  The value of an instance of an immutable type never changes.  Since
object sharing is noticeable only for mutable types, they are checked
differently from immutable types.<p>
The <tt>/&#42;@mutable@&#42;/</tt> and <tt>/&#42;@immutable@&#42;/</tt> annotations are used to declare an
abstract type as mutable or immutable.  (If neither is used, the abstract type
is assumed to be mutable.)  For example,<p>
<code>
   typedef /&#42;@abstract@&#42;/ /&#42;@mutable@&#42;/ char &#42;mstring;
   typedef /&#42;@abstract@&#42;/ /&#42;@immutable@&#42;/ int weekDay;
</code>
declares mstring as a mutable abstract type and weekDay as  an immutable
abstract type.<p>
<p>
Clients of  a mutable abstract type need to know the semantics of assignment.
After the assignment expression s = t, do s and t refer to the same object
(that is, will changes to the value of s also change the value of t)?<p>
<p>
LCLint prescribes that all abstract types have sharing semantics, so s and t
would indeed be the same object.  LCLint will report an error if a mutable type
is implemented with a representation (e.g., a struct) that does not provide
sharing semantics (controlled by mutrep flag).  <p>
<p>
The mutability of an abstract type is not necessarily the same as the
mutability of its representation. We could use the immutable concrete type int
to represent mutable strings using an index into a string table, or declare
mstring as immutable as long as no operations are provided that modify the
value of an mstring.

<a name="RTFToC11">
<a name="sec-3.3">3.3 Boolean Types</A></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Standard C has no boolean representation - the result of a comparison operator
is an integer, and no type checking is done for test expressions.  Many common
errors can be detected by introducing a distinct boolean type and stronger type
checking.<p>
<p>
Use the <tt>-booltype </tt><em>name</em> flag to select the type name
used to represent boolean values<a
href="guide_fn.html#fn8">[8]</a>  Relations,
comparisons and certain standard library functions are declared to return bool
types.<p>

LCLint checks that the test expression in an if, while, or for statement
or an operand to &amp;&amp;, || or ! is a boolean.  If the type of a test
expression is not a boolean, LCLint will report an error depending on the type
of the test expression and flag settings.  If the test expression has pointer
type, LCLint reports an error if predboolptr is on (this can be used to prevent
messages for the idiom of  testing if a pointer is not null without a
comparison).  If it is type int, an error is reported if predboolint is on.
For all other types, LCLint reports an error if predboolothers is on.<p>
<p>
Since using <tt>=</tt> instead of <tt>==</tt> is such a common bug, reporting of test expressions
that are assignments is controlled by the separate predassign flag.  The
message can be suppressed by adding extra parentheses around the test
expression.<p>

LCLint supports stricter checking of primitive C types.  The char and enum
types can be checked as distinct types, and the different numeric types can be
type-checked strictly.
<a name="_Toc349905854">
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC13">
<a name="sec-3.4.1">3.4.1 Characters</A></a>
</a></h4>
The primitive char type can be type-checked as a distinct type.  If char is
used as a distinct type, common errors involving assigning ints to chars are
detected.<p>
<p>
The <a href="appC.html#flag-charint"><tt>+charint</tt></a> flag can be used for checking legacy programs where char and int
are used interchangeably.  If charint is on, char types indistinguishable from
ints.  To keep char and int as distinct types, but allow chars to be used to
index arrays, use <a href="appC.html#flag-charindex"><tt>+charindex</tt></a>.
<a name="_Toc349905855">
<h4>
<a name="sec-3.4.2">3.4.2 Enumerators</A></a>
</a></h4>
Standard C treats user-declared enum types just like integers.  An arbitrary
integral value may be assigned to an enum type, whether or not it was listed as
an enumerator member.  LCLint checks each user-defined enum type as distinct
type.  An error is reported if a value that is not an enumerator member is
assigned to the enum type, or if an enum type is used as an operand to an
arithmetic operator.<p>
<p>
If the enumint flag is on, enum and int types may be used interchangeably.
Like charindex, if  the enumindex flag is on, enum types may be used to index
arrays.
<h4>
<a name="sec-3.4.3">3.4.3 Numeric Types</A></a>
</a></h4>
LCLint reports where numeric types are used in dangerous or inconsistent ways.
With the strictest checking, LCLint will report an error anytime numeric types
do not match exactly.  If the relaxquals flag is on, only those
inconsistencies which may corrupt values are reported.  For example, if an int
is assigned to a variable of type long (or passed as a long formal parameter),
LCLint will not report an error if relaxquals is on since a long must have
at least enough bits to store an int without data loss.  On the other hand, an
error would be reported if the long were assigned to an int, since the int type
may not have enough bits to store the long value.<p>
<p>
Similarly, if a signed value is assigned to an unsigned, LCLint will report an
error since an unsigned type cannot represent all signed values correctly.  If
the ignoresigns flag is on, checking is relaxed to ignore all sign qualifiers
in type comparisons (this is not recommended, since it will suppress reporting
of real bugs, but may be necessary for quickly checking certain legacy code).  

<h4>
<a name="sec-3.4.4">3.4.4 Arbitrary Integral Types</A></a>
</a></h4>

LCLint supports three different kinds of arbitrary integral types:
<p>
<blockquote>
<tt>/&#42;@integraltype@&#42;/</tt>
<blockquote>
An arbitrary integral type.  The actual type may be any one of
<tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, <tt>long</tt>, <tt>unsigned short</tt>, <tt>unsigned</tt>, or <tt>unsigned long</tt>. 
</blockquote>
<p>
<tt>/&#42;@unsignedintegraltype@&#42;/</tt>
<blockquote>
An arbitrary unsigned integral type.  The actual type may be any one of
<tt>unsigned short</tt>, <tt>unsigned</tt>, or <tt>unsigned long</tt>.
</blockquote>

<p>
<tt>/&#42;@signedintegraltype@&#42;/</tt>
<blockquote>
An arbitrary signed integral type.  The actual type may be any one of
<tt>short</tt>, <tt>int</tt>, or <tt>long</tt>. 
</blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>
LCLint reports an error if the code depends on the actual representation
of a type declared as an arbitrary integral.  The <a
href="appC.html#flag-matchanyintegral"><tt>match-any-integral</tt></a>
flag relaxes checking and allows an arbitrary integral type is allowed
to match any integral type. 

<p>

Other flags set the arbitrary integral types to a concrete type.  These
should only be used if portability to platforms that may use different
representations is not important.  The <tt>long-integral</tt> and
<tt>long-unsigned-integral</tt> flags set the type corresponding to
<tt>/&#42;@integraltype@&#42;/</tt> to be <tt>unsigned long</tt> and
<tt>long</tt> respectively. The <tt>long-unsigned-unsigned-integral</tt>
flag sets the type corresponding to <tt>/&#42;@unsignedintegraltype@&#42;/</tt>
to be <tt>unsigned long</tt>. The <tt>long-signed-integral</tt>
flag sets the type corresponding to <tt>/&#42;@signedintegraltype@&#42;/</tt> to
be <tt>long</tt>.
