5. Memory Management
</a></h2>
About half the bugs in typical C programs can be attributed to memory
management problems.  Memory management bugs are notoriously difficult to
detect through traditional techniques.  Often, the symptom of the bug is far
removed from its actual source.  Memory management bug often only appear
sporadically and some bugs may only be apparent when compiler optimizations are
turned on or the code is compiled on a different platform.  Run-time tools
offer some help, but are cumbersome to use and limited to detecting errors that
occur when test cases are run.  By detecting these errors statically, we can be
confident that certain types of errors will never occur and provide verified
documentation on the memory management behavior of a program.  <p>
<p>
LCLint can detect many memory management errors at compile time including:<p>
<ul>
<li>	using storage that may have been freed (<a href="sec5.html#sec-5.2">Section 5.2</a>)<p>
<li>	failing to deallocate memory (<a href="sec5.html#sec-5.2">Section 5.2</a>)<p>
<li>	returning a pointer to stack-allocated storage (<a href="sec5.html#sec-5.2.6">Section 5.2.6</a>)<p>
<li>	undocumented or dangerous aliasing or storage sharing (<a href="sec6.html">Section 6</a>)<p>
<li>	passing or returning storage that is not completely defined (<a
href="sec7.html#sec-7.1">Section 7.1</a>)<p>
<li>	dereferencing a null pointers (<a href="sec7.html#sec-7.2">Section 7.2</a>)<p>
</ul>

Most of these checks rely heavily on annotations added to programs to document
assumptions related to memory management and pointer values.  By documenting
these assumptions for function interfaces, variables, type definitions and
structure fields, memory management bugs can be detected at their source --
where an assumption is violated.  In addition, precise documentation about
memory management decisions makes its easier to change code.

</blockquote>

This section describes execution-time concepts for describing the state of
storage more precisely than can be done using standard C terminology.  Certain
uses of storage are likely to indicate program bugs, and are reported as
anomalies.<p>
<p>
LCL assumes a CLU-like object storage model.<a
href="guide_fn.html#fn11">[11]</a>  An <i>object</i> is a typed region
of storage.  Some objects use a fixed amount of storage that is allocated and deallocated automatically by the
compiler.<p>
Other objects use dynamic storage that must be managed by the program.<p>
<p>
Storage is <i>undefined</i> if it has not been assigned a value, and
<i>defined</i> after it has been assigned a value.  An object is <i>completely
defined</i> if all storage that may be reached from it is defined.  What
storage is reachable from an object depends on the type and value of the
object.  For example, if p is a pointer to a structure, p is completely defined
if the value of p is NULL, or if every field of the structure p points to is
completely defined.<p>
<p>
When an expression is used as the left side of an assignment expression we say
it is <i>used as an lvalue</i>.  Its location in memory is used, but not its
value.  Undefined storage may be used as an lvalue since only its location is
needed.  When storage is used in any other way, such as on the right side of an
assignment, as an operand to a primitive operator (including the indirection
operator, &#42;),<a href="guide_fn.html#fn12">[12]</a> or as a<p>
function parameter, we say it is <i>used as an rvalue</i>.  It is an
anomaly to use undefined storage as an rvalue.<p>
<p>
A <i>pointer</i> is a typed memory address.  A pointer is either <i>live</i> or
<i>dead</i>.  A live pointer is either NULL or an address within allocated
storage.  A pointer that points to an object is an <i>object</i> pointer.  A
pointer that points inside an object (e.g., to the third element of an
allocated block) is an <i>offset</i> pointer.  A pointer that points to
allocated storage that is not defined is an <i>allocated</i> pointer.  The
result of dereferencing an allocated pointer is undefined storage.  Hence, it
is an anomaly to use it as an rvalue.  A dead (or "dangling") pointer does not
point to allocated storage.  A pointer becomes dead if the storage it points to
is deallocated (e.g., the pointer is passed to the free library function.)  It
is an anomaly to use a dead pointer as an rvalue.<p>
<p>
There is a special object <i>null</i> corresponding to the NULL pointer in a C
program.  A pointer that may have the value NULL is a <i>possibly-null</i>
pointer.  It is an anomaly to use a possibly-null pointer where a non-null
pointer is expected (e.g., certain function arguments or the indirection
operator).

<a name="sec-5.2">5.2 Deallocation Errors</A></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
There are two kinds of deallocation errors with which we are concerned:
deallocating storage when there are other live references to the same storage,
or failing to deallocate storage before the last  reference to it is lost.  To
handle these deallocation errors, we introduce a concept of an obligation to
release storage.  Every time storage is allocated, it creates an obligation to
release the storage.  This obligation is attached to the reference to which the
storage is assigned.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn13">[13]</a>  Before the scope of the
reference is exited or it is assigned to a new value, the storage to which it
points must be released.  Annotations can be used to indicate that this
obligation is transferred through a return value, function parameter or
assignment to an external reference.

</a></h4>

<blockquote>
<em>`Tis in my memory lock'd, and you yourself shall keep the key of it.</em><br>
- Ophelia prefers explicit deallocation (Hamlet.  Act I, Scene iii)
</blockquote>

The only annotation is used to indicate a reference is the only pointer to the
object it points to.  We can view the reference as having an obligation to
release this storage.  This obligation is satisfied by transferring it to some other reference in one of three ways:<p>
<ul>
<li>	pass it as an actual parameter corresponding to a formal parameter
declared with an only annotation               
<li>	assign it to an external reference declared with an only annotation
<li>	return it as a result declared with an only annotation
</ul>

After the release obligation is transferred, the original reference is a dead
pointer and the storage it points to may not be used. <p>

<p>
All obligations to release storage stem from primitive allocation routines
(e.g., malloc), and are ultimately satisfied by calls to free.  The standard
library declared the primitive allocation and deallocation routines.
<p>
The basic memory allocator, malloc, is declared:<a
href="guide_fn.html#fn14">[14]</a>
</a><p><pre>
/&#42;@only@&#42;/ void &#42;malloc (size_t size);
</pre>
It returns an object that is referenced only by the function return value.  <p>
<p>
The deallocator, free, is declared:<a href="guide_fn.html#fn15">[15]</a><p>
<pre>
void free (/&#42;@only@&#42;/ void &#42;ptr);
</pre>
<a name="_Ref344990094"><p>
The parameter to free must reference an unshared object.  Since the parameter
is declared using only, the caller may not use the referenced object after the
call, and may not pass in a reference to a shared object.  There is nothing
special about malloc and free -- their behavior can be described entirely in
terms of the provided annotations</a>.

<a name="sec-5.2.2">5.2.2 Temporary Parameters</A></a></a>
</a></h4>
The temp annotation is used to declare a function parameter that is used
temporarily by the function.  An error is reported if the function releases the
storage associated with a temp formal parameter or creates new aliases it that
are visible after the function returns.  Any storage may be passed as a temp
parameter, and it satisfies its original memory constraints after the function
returns.

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC29">
<a name="sec-5.2.3">5.2.3 Owned and Dependent References</a></a></a>
</a></h4>
In real programs it is sometimes necessary to have storage that is shared
between several possibly references.  The owned and dependent annotations
provide a more flexible way of managing storage, at the cost of less checking.
The owned annotation denotes a reference with an obligation to release storage.
Unlike only, however, other external references marked with dependent
annotations may share this object.  It is up to the programmer to ensure that
the lifetime of a dependent reference is contained within the lifetime of the
corresponding owned reference.

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC30">
<a name="sec-5.2.4">5.2.4 Kept Parameters</A></a></a>
</a></h4>
The keep annotation is similar to only, except the caller may use the reference
after the call.  The called function must assign the keep parameter to an only
reference, or pass it as a keep parameter to another function.  It is up to the
programmer to make sure that the calling function does not use this reference
after it is released.  The keep annotation is useful for adding an object to a
collection (e.g., a symbol table), where it is known that it will not be
deallocated until the collection is.

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC31">
<a name="sec-5.2.5">5.2.5 Shared References</A></a></a>
</a></h4>
If LCLint is used to check a program designed to be used in a garbage-collected
environment, there may be storage that is shared by one or more references and
never explicitly released.  The shared annotation declares storage that may be
shared arbitrarily, but never released.

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC32">
<a name="sec-5.2.6">5.2.6 Stack References</A></a></a>
</a></h4>
Local variables that are not allocated dynamically are store on a call stack.
When a function returns, its stack frame is deallocated, destroying the storage
associated with the function's local variables.  A memory error occurs if a
pointer into this storage is live after the function returns.  LCLint detects
errors involving stack references exported from a function through return
values or assignments to references reachable from global variables or actual
parameters.  No annotations are needed to detect stack reference errors, since
it is clear from a declaration if storage is allocated on the function stack.

<h4>
<a name="RTFToC33">
<a name="sec-5.2.7">5.2.7 Inner Storage</A></a>
</a></h4>
An annotation always applies to the outermost level of storage.  For example,
<pre>
/&#42;@only@&#42;/ int &#42;&#42;x;
</pre>
declares x as an unshared pointer to a pointer to an int.  The only annotation
applies to x, but not to &#42;x.  To apply annotations to inner storage a type
definition may be used:
<pre>
  typedef /&#42;@only@&#42;/ int &#42;oip;
  /&#42;@only@&#42;/ oip &#42;x;
</pre>
Now, x is an only pointer to an oip, which is an only pointer to an int.<p>
<p>
When annotations are use in type definitions, they may be overridden in
instance declarations.  For example,
<pre>
/&#42;@dependent@&#42;/ oip x;
</pre>
makes x a dependent pointer to an int.

<a name="RTFToC34">
<a name="sec-5.3">5.3 Implicit Memory Annotations</A></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Since it is important that LCLint can check unannotated programs effectively,
the meaning of declarations with no memory annotations is chosen to minimize
the number of annotations needed to get useful checking on an unannotated
program. <p>
<p>
An implicit memory management annotation may be assumed for declarations with
no explicit memory management annotation.  Implicit annotations are checked
identically to the corresponding explicit annotation, except error messages
indicate that they result from an implicit annotation.<p>
<p>
Unannotated function parameters are assumed to be temp.  This means if memory
checking is turned on for an unannotated program, all functions that release
storage referenced by a parameter or assign a global variable to alias the
storage will produce error messages.  (Controlled by paramimptemp.)<p>
<p>
Unannotated return values, structure fields and global variables are assumed to
be only.  With implicit annotations (on by default), turning on memory checking
for an unannotated program will produce errors for any function that does not
return unshared storage or assignment of shared storage to a global variable or
structure field.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn16">[16]</a>  (Controlled by
<a href="appC.html#flag-retimponly"><tt>retimponly</tt></a>, <a

href="appC.html#flag-globimponly"><tt>globimponly</tt></a>.  The <a
href="appC.html#flag-codeimponly"><tt>codeimponly</tt></a> flag sets all of the implicit only flags.)

<a name="RTFToC35">
<a name="sec-5.4">5.4 Reference Counting</A></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Another approach to memory management is to add a field to a type to explicitly
keep track of the number of references to that storage.  Every time a reference
is added or lost the reference count is adjusted accordingly;  if it would
become zero, the storage is released.  Reference counting it difficult to do
without automatic checking since it is easy to forget to increment or decrement
the reference count, and exceedingly difficult to track down these errors.<p>
<p>
LCLint supports reference counting by using annotations to constrain the use of
reference counted storage in a manner similar to other memory management
annotations.<p>
<p>
A reference counted type is declared using the refcounted annotation.  Only
pointer to struct types may be declared as reference counted, since reference
counted storage must have a field to count the references.  One field in the
structure (or integral type) is preceded by the refs annotation to indicate
that the value of this field is the number of live references to the structure.
<p>
 <p>
For example (in <tt>rstring.h</tt>),
<pre>
     typedef /&#42;@abstract@&#42;/ /&#42;@refcounted@&#42;/ struct {
	  /&#42;@refs@&#42;/ int refs;
        char &#42;contents;
      } &#42;rstring;
</pre>
declares rstring as an abstract, reference-counted type.  The refs field counts
the number of references and the contents field holds the contents of a
string.<p>
<p>
All functions that return refcounted storage must increase the reference count
before returning.  LCLint cannot determine if the reference count was
increased, so any function that directly returns a reference to refcounted
storage will produce an error.  This is avoided, by using a function to return
a new reference (e.g., rstring_ref in Figure 9).<p>
<p>
A reference counted type may be passed as a temp or dependent parameter.  It
may not be passed as an only parameter.  Instead, the killref annotation is
used to denote a parameter whose reference is eliminated by the function call.
Like only parameters, an actual parameter corresponding to a killref formal
parameter may not be used in the calling function after the call.  LCLint
checks that the implementation of a function releases all killref parameters,
either by passing them as killref parameters, or assigning or returning them
without increasing the reference count.<p>
