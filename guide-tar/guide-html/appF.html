<h2>Appendix F  Libraries</h2></a></a></a></b><p>
<b></b>Libraries can be used to record interface information.  A library
containing information about the  Standard C Library is used to enable checking
of library calls.  Program libraries can be created to enable fast checking of
single modules in a large program.
<p>
<b><i>Standard Libraries</i></b>
<p>
In order to check calls to library functions, LCLint uses an
annotated standard library.  This contains more information about function
interfaces then is available in the system header files since it uses
annotations.  Further, it contains only those functions documented in the ANSI
Standard.  Many systems include extra functions in their system libraries;
programs that use these functions cannot be compiled on other systems that do
not provide them.  Certain types defined by the library are treated as abstract
types (e.g., a program should not rely on how the FILE type is implemented).
When checking source code, LCLint does include system headers according to
include directive in the source code, but instead uses the library description
of the standard library.<p>
<p>

The LCLint distribution includes several different standard libraries:
the ANSI standard library, the POSIX standard library , and an ad hoc
UNIX library.  Each library comes in two versions: the standard version
and the strict version.
<p>
<b>ANSI Library</b>
<p>

The default behavior of LCLint is to use the ANSI standard library
(loaded from <tt>ansi.lcd</tt>).  This library is based on the standard library
described in the ANSI C Standard.  It includes functions and types added
by Amendment 1 to the ANSI C Standard.
<p>

<b>POSIX Library</b>
<p>

The POSIX library is selected by the <tt>+posixlib</tt> flag.  The POSIX library
is based on the IEEE Std 1003.1-1990.  
<p>

<b>UNIX Library</b>
<p>

The UNIX library is selected by the <tt>+unixlib</tt> flag.  This
library is an ad hoc attempt to capture additional functionality
provided by many UNIX platforms. Unfortunately, UNIX systems vary widely
and very few are consistent with the ANSI Standard.
<p>
The differences between the UNIX library and the POSIX library are:
<ul>
<li>  In the UNIX library, <tt>free</tt> is declared with a non-null
parameter.  ANSI C specifies that <tt>free</tt> should handle the
argument <tt>NULL</tt>, but several UNIX platforms crash if <tt>NULL</tt> is
passed to <tt>free</tt>. 
<li>   Extra variables, constants and functions are included in the UNIX
library.  Some declarations are not  part of the POSIX library, but are
believed to be available on many UNIX systems.  See <tt>lib/1.h</tt>
for a list of the UNIX-only declarations. 
</ul>
<p>
Code checked using the UNIX library can probably be ported to some UNIX
systems without difficulty.  To enhance the likelihood that a program is
portable, the POSIX library should be used instead.
<p>
<b>Strict Libraries</b>
<p>
Stricter versions of the libraries are used if the
<tt>-ansi-strict</tt>, <tt>posix-strict-lib</tt> or
<tt>1-strct-lib</tt> flag is used. These libraries use a stricter
interpretation of the library.  They will detect more errors in some programs, but may to produce many spurious errors for typical code. 
<p>
The differences between the standard libraries and the strict libraries
are:
<ul>
<li> The standard libraries declare the printing functions
(<tt>fprintf</tt>, <tt>printf</tt>, and <tt>sprintf</tt>) that may
return error codes to return <tt>int</tt> or <tt>void</tt>.  This prevents typical
programs from leading to deluge of ignored return value errors, but may
mean some relevant errors are not detected.  In the strict libraries, they
are declared to return <tt>int</tt>, so ignored return value errors will
be reported (depending on other flag settings).  Programs should check
that this return value is non-negative. 

<li> 
The standard libraries declare some parameters and return values to be
alternate types (<tt>int</tt> or <tt>bool</tt>, or <tt>int</tt> or
<tt>char</tt>).  The ANSI standard specifies these types as int to be
compatible with older versions of the library, but logically they make
more sense as <tt>bool</tt> or <tt>char</tt>.  In the strict libraries,
the stronger type is used.  The parameter to <tt>assert</tt> is
<tt>int</tt> or <tt>bool</tt> in the standard library, and <tt>bool</tt>
in the strict library.  The parameter to the character functions
isalnum, isalpha, iscntrl, isdigit, isgraph, islower, isprint, ispunct,
isspace, isupper, isxdigit, tolower and toupper is char or int in the
standard library and char in the strict library.  The type of the return
value of the character classification functions (all of the previous
character functions except tolower and toupper) is bool or int in the
standard library and bool in the strict library.  The type of the first
parameter to ungetc is char or int in the standard library and char in
the strict library (EOF should not be passed to ungetc).  The second
parameter to strchr and strrchr is char or int in the standard library
and char in the strict library.

<li> The global variables stdin, stdout and stderr are declared as
unchecked variables (see <a href="sec4.html#sec-4.2.1">Section
4.2.1</a>) in the standard libraries.  In the strict libraries, they are checked.  The global variable errno is declared unchecked in the standard
libraries, but declared checkedstrict in the strict libraries.
</ul>
<p>

<b>Generating the Standard Libraries</b>
<p>

The standard libraries are generated from header files included in the
LCLint distribution.  Some libraries are generated from more than one
header file.  Since the POSIX library includes the ANSI library, the
headers for the ANSI and POSIX libraries are combined to produce the
POSIX library.  Similarly, the UNIX library is composed of the ANSI,
POSIX and UNIX headers.  The header files include some sections that are
conditionally selected by defining <tt>STRICT</tt>.
<p>
The commands to generate the standard libraries are:
<blockquote>
<pre>
lclint -nolib ansi.h -dump ansi 
lclint -nolib -DSTRICT ansi.h -dump ansistrict
lclint -nolib ansi.h posix.h -dump posix
lclint -nolib -DSTRICT ansi.h posix.h -dump posixstrict
lclint -nolib ansi.h posix.h 1.h -dump 1
lclint -nolib -DSTRICT ansi.h posix.h 1.h -dump unixstrict
</pre>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b><i>User Libraries</a></a></i></b><p>
<b><i></i></b>To enable running LCLint on large systems, mechanisms are
provided for creating libraries containing necessary information.  This means
source files can be checked independently, after a library has been created.
The command line option -dump <i>library</i> stores information in the file
<i>library</i> (the default extension, <tt>.lcd</tt><a href="guide_fn.html#fn27">[27]</a>, is
added). Then, <tt>-load </tt><i>library</i> loads the library.  The library
contains interface information from the files checked when the library was
created.
<p>
<a name="headers">
<b><i>
Header File Inclusion
</i></b>
<p>
The standard behavior of LCLint on encountering 
<pre>
   #include &lt;X.h&gt;
</pre>

is to search for a file named <tt>X.h</tt> on the include search path
(set using <tt>-I</tt>) and then the system base include path (usually
<tt>/usr/include</tt>, default is set when LCLint is compiled).  If <tt>X.h</tt> is the name of a header file in a loaded standard library (either
ANSI or POSIX) and <tt>X.h</tt> is found in a directory that is a system
directory (as set by the <tt>-sysdirs</tt> flag; the default is <tt>/usr/include</tt>),
<tt>X.h</tt> will not be included if <tt>skip-ansi-headers</tt> or
<tt>skip-posix-headers</tt> (depending on whether <tt>X.h</tt> is an
ANSI or POSIX header file) is on (both are on by default).  To force all
headers to be included normally, use <tt>-skip-ansi-headers</tt> and
<tt>-skip-posix-headers</tt>.
<p>

Sometimes headers in system directories contain non-standard syntax
which LCLint is unable to parse.  The <tt>+skip-sys-headers</tt> flag
may be used to prevent any include file in a system directory from being
included. 

<p>
LCLint is fast enough that it can be run on medium-size (10,000
line) programs without performance concerns.  It takes about one second to
process a thousand source lines on a DEC Alpha.  Libraries can be used to
enable efficient checking of small modules in large programs.  To further
improve performance, header file inclusion can be optimized.<p>
<p>
When processing a complete system in which many files include the same headers,
a large fraction of processing time is wasted re-reading header files
unnecessarily.  If you are checking a 100-file program, and every file includes
<tt>utils.h</tt>, LCLint will have to process utils.h 100 times (as would most C
compilers).  If the <a href="appC.html#flag-singleinclude"><tt>+singleinclude</tt></a> flag is used, each header file is processed
only once.  Single header file processing produces a significant efficiency
improvement when checking large programs split into many files, but is only
safe if the same header file included in different contexts always has the same
meaning (i.e., it does not depend on preprocessor variable defined differently
at different inclusion sites).<p>
<p>
When processing a single file in a large system, a large fraction of the time
is spent processing included header files.  This can be avoided if the
information in the header files is stored in a library instead.  If
<a href="appC.html#flag-neverinclude"><tt>+neverinclude</tt></a> is set, inclusion of files ending in .h is prevented.  Files with
different suffixes are included normally.  To do this the header files must not
include any expanded macros. That is, the header file must be processed with
<a href="appC.html#flag-allmacros"><tt>+allmacros</tt></a>, and there must be no <tt>/&#42;@notfunction@*/</tt> control comments in the
header.  Then, the <a href="appC.html#flag-neverinclude"><tt>+neverinclude</tt></a> flag may be used to prevent inclusion of header
files.  Alternately, non-function macros can be moved to a different file with
a name that does not end in <tt>.h</tt>.  Remember, that this file must be included
directly from the <tt>.c</tt> file, since if it is included from a <tt>.h</tt> file indirectly,
that <tt>.h</tt> file is ignored so the other file is never included.<p>
<p>
These options can be used for significant performance improvements on large
systems.  The performance depends on how the code is structured, but checking a
single module in a large program is several times faster if libraries and
<a href="appC.html#flag-neverinclude"><tt>+neverinclude</tt></a> are used.
