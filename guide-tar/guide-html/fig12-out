exposure.c: (in function employee_getName)
<A HREF="exposure.c.html#line6" target="source">exposure.c:6,10</A>: Function returns reference to
                    parameter e: e->name
  The returned value shares storage with a parameter
  or global. If a parameter is to be returned, use the
  returned qualifier. If the result is not modified,
  use the observer qualifier on the result type.
  Otherwise, exposed can be used, but limited checking
  is done. (-retalias will suppress message)
<A HREF="exposure.c.html#line6" target="source">exposure.c:6,10</A>: Return value exposes rep of employee:
                    e->name
  The return value shares storage with an instance of
  an abstract type. This means clients may have access
  to a pointer into the abstract representation. Use
  the observer qualifier to return exposed storage
  that may not be modified by the client. Use the
  exposed qualifier to return modifiable (but not
  deallocatable) exposed storage (dangerous).
  (-retexpose will suppress message)
<A HREF="exposure.c.html#line6" target="source">exposure.c:6,18</A>: Released storage e->name reachable
                    from parameter at return point
  Memory is used after it has been released (either by
  passing as an only param or assigning to and only
  global. (-usereleased will suppress message)

  Storage declared with observer is possibly modified.
  Observer storage may not be modified. (-modobserver
  will suppress message)
