    distinguishable from lookalike except by lookalike
    characters
  An internal name is not distinguishable from another
  internal name using the number of significant
  characters. According to ANSI Standard (3.1), an
  implementation may only consider the first 31
  characters significant. The +internalnamelen <n>
  flag changes the number of significant characters,
  -internalnamecaseinsensitive to makes alphabetical
  case significant, and +internalnamelookalike to make
  similar-looking characters non-distinct.
