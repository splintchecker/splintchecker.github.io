order.c: (in function f)
<A HREF="order.c.html#line11" target="source">order.c:11,17</A>: Expression has undefined behavior
    (value of right operand modified by left operand):
    x++ * x
  Code has unspecified behavior. Order of evaluation
  of function parameters or subexpressions is not
  defined, so if a value is used and modified in
  different places not separated by a sequence point
  constraining evaluation order, then the result of
  the expression is unspecified. (-evalorder will
  suppress message)
<A HREF="order.c.html#line13" target="source">order.c:13,11</A>: Expression has undefined behavior (left
    operand uses i, modified by right operand):
    y[i] = i++
<A HREF="order.c.html#line14" target="source">order.c:14,20</A>: Expression has undefined behavior
    (value of right operand modified by left operand):
    modglob() * glob
<A HREF="order.c.html#line15" target="source">order.c:15,20</A>: Expression has undefined behavior
    (unconstrained function mystery used in left
    operand may set global variable glob used in right
    operand): mystery() * glob
  Code involving a call to function with no modifies
  or globals clause may have undefined or
  implementation-dependent behavior (LCLint assumes
  the unconstrained call may modify any reachable
  state or use any global). Add a specification for
  the function. (-evalorderuncon will suppress
  message)
