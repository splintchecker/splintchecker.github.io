2. Operation</a></a>
</a></h2>
LCLint is invoked by listing files to be checked.  Initialization files,
command line flags, and stylized comments may be used to customize checking
globally and locally.<p>
<p>
The best way to learn to use LCLint, of course, is to actually use it (if you
don't already have LCLint installed on your system, <a
href="../download.html">download it</A>).  Before you
read much further in this document, I recommend finding a small C program.
Then, try running:<p>
<code>lclint *.c</code><p>
For the most C programs, this will produce a large number of messages.  To turn
off reporting for some of the messages, try:<p>
<code>lclint -weak *.c</code><p>
The <a href="appC.html#flag-weak"><tt>-weak</tt></a> flag is a mode
flag that sets many checking parameters to select weaker checking than
is done in the default mode.  Other LCLint flags will be introduced in the following sections;  a complete list is given in <a href="appC.html">Appendix C</a>.
<h4>
<a name="sec-2.1">2.1 Messages
</a></h4>
The format and content of messages printed by LCLint can be customized by the
user. A typical message is:<p>
<blockquote>
<pre>
sample.c: (in function faucet)
sample.c:11:12: Fresh storage x not released before return
  A memory leak has been detected.  Newly-allocated or only-qualified storage
  is not released before the last reference to is it lost.  Use -mustfree to
  suppress message.
   sample.c:5:47: Fresh storage x allocated
</pre>
</blockquote>
The first line gives the name of the function in which the error is found.
This is printed before the first message reported for a function.  (The
function context is not printed if <a
href="appC.html#flag-showfunc"><tt>-showfunc</tt></a> is used.) <p> 
<p>
The second line is the text of the message.  This message reports a memory leak
- storage allocated in a function is not deallocated before the function
returns. The text is preceded by the file name, line and column number where
the error is located.  The column numbers are used by the emacs mode (see
<a href="appH.html">Appendix&nbsp;H</a>) to jump to the
appropriate line and column location.  (Column numbers are not printed
if <a href="appC.html#flag-showcolumn"><tt>-showcolumn</tt></a> is used.)  <p>
<p>
The next line is a hint giving more information about the suspected error.
Most hints also include information on how the message may be suppressed.   For
this message, setting the <a
href="appC.html#flag-mustfree"><tt>-mustfree</tt></a> flag would
prevent the message from being reported.  Hints may be turned off by
using <a href="appC.html#flag-hints"><tt>-hints</tt></a>.  Normally, a hint is given only the first time a class of error is reported.
To have LCLint print a hint for every message regardless, use <a href="appC.html#flag-forcehints"><tt>+forcehints</tt></a>.<p>
<p>
The final line of the message gives additional location information.  For this
message, it tells where the leaking storage is allocated.<p>
<p>
The generic message format is (parts enclosed in square brackets are
optional):<p>
<pre>
  [&lt;file&gt;:&lt;line&gt; (in &lt;context&gt;)]
  &lt;file&gt;:&lt;line&gt;[,&lt;column&gt;]: <i>message</i>
     [<i>hint</i>]
      &lt;file&gt;:&lt;line&gt;,&lt;column&gt;: <i>extra location information, if appopriate</i><p>
</pre>
The text of messages and hints may be longer than one line.  They are split
into lines of length less than the value set using <a href="appC.html#flag-linelen"><tt>-linelen</tt></a>
<i>&lt;number&gt;</i>.  The default line length is 80 characters.  LCLint
attempts to split lines in a sensible place as near to the line length limit as
possible.  
<p>
The <a
href="appC.html#flag-parenfileformat"><tt>+parenfileformat</tt></a> flag
can be used to generate file locations in the format recognized by
Microsoft Developer Studio.  If <tt>+parenfileformat</tt> is set, the
line number follows the file name in parentheses (e.g.,
<tt>sample.c(11)</tt>.).

<a name="sec-2.2">2.2 Flags</A></a></a></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h4>
So that many programming styles can be supported, LCLint provides over 300
flags for controlling checking and message reporting.  Some of the flags are
introduced in the body of this document.  <a href="appC.html">Apppendix C</a> describes every flag.
Modes and shortcut flags are provided for setting many flags at once.
Individual flags can override the mode settings.<p>
<p>
Flags are preceded by + or -.  When a flag is preceded by + we say it is
<i>on</i>; when it is preceded by - it is <i>off</i>. The precise meaning of on
and off depends on the type of flag.  <p>
<p>
The +/- flag settings are used for consistency and clarity, but contradict
standard UNIX usage and is easy to accidentally use the wrong one.  To reduce
the likelihood of using the wrong flag, LCLint issues warnings when a flag is
set in an unusual way.  Warnings are issued when a flag is redundantly set to
the value it already had (these errors are not reported if the flag is set
using a stylized comment), if a mode flag or special flag is set after a more
specific flag that will be set by the general flag was already set, if value
flags are given unreasonable values, of if flags are set in an inconsistent
way.  The <a href="appC.html#flag-warnflags"><tt>-warnflags</tt></a> flag suppresses these warnings.<p>
<p>

<a name="lclintrc">
Default flag settings will be read from <tt>~/.lclintrc</tt> if it is
readable (in Windows, the <tt>$HOME/lclint.rc</tt> file is used).  If
there is a <tt>.lclintrc</tt> file in the working directory, settings
in this file will be read next and its settings will override those in
<tt>~/.lclintrc</tt>.  Command-line flags override settings in either
file.  The syntax of the <tt>.lclintrc</tt> file is the same as that
of command-line flags, except that flags may be on separate lines and
the <tt>#</tt> character may be used to indicate that the remainder of
the line is a comment. The <a
href="appC.html#flag-nof"><tt>-nof</tt></a> flag prevents the
<tt>~/.lclintrc</tt> file from being loaded.  The <a
href="appC.html#flag-f"><tt>-f</tt></a> <i>&lt;filename&gt;</i> flag
loads options from <i>filename</i>.  <a name="_Ref343086686"><a

<a name="sec-2.3">2.3 Stylized Comments</A></a></a></a> </a></h4>
Stylized comments are used to provide extra information about a type,
variable or function interface to improve checking, or to control flag
settings locally.<p> <p> All stylized comments begin with <tt>/*@</tt>
and are closed by the end of the comment.  The role of the <tt>@</tt>
may be played by any printable character.  Use <a
href="appC.html#flag-commentchar"><tt>-commentchar</tt></a>
<i>&lt;char&gt;</i> to select a different stylized comment marker.
<h4> <a name="sec-2.3.1">2.3.1 Annotations </a></h4> Annotations are
stylized comments that follow a definite syntax.  Although they are
comments, they may only be used in fixed grammatical contexts (e.g.,
like a type qualifier).<p> <p> Syntactic comments for function
interfaces are described in <a href="sec4.html">Section 4</a>;
comments for declaring constants in <a
href="sec8.html#sec-8.1">Section 8.1.</a> and comments for declaring
iterators in <a href="sec8.html#sec-8.4">Section 8.4.</a> Sections 3-8
include descriptions of annotations for expressing assumptions about
variables, parameters, return values, structure fields and type
definitions.  A summary of annotations is found in <a
href="appD.html">Apppendix D</a>.

<h4>
<a name="sec-2.3.2">2.3.2 Control Comments
</a></h4>
Unlike annotations, control comments may appear between any two tokens in a C
program.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn3">[3]</a>  Syntactically, they are no
different from standard comments.  Control comments are used to provide
source-level control of LCLint checking.  They may be used to suppress spurious
messages, set flags, and control checking locally in other ways.  A complete
description of control comments is found in <a href="appE.html">Apppendix E</a>.<p>
<p>
Most flags (all except those characterized as "global" in <a href="appC.html">Apppendix C</a>) can be
set locally using control comments.  A control comment can set flags locally to
override the command line settings.  The original flag settings are restored
before processing the next file. The syntax for setting flags in control
comments is the same as that of the command line, except that flags may also be
preceded by = to restore their setting to the original command-line value.  For
instance,
<pre>
/*@+boolint -modifies =showfunc@*/
</pre>
sets <a href="appC.html#flag-boolint"><tt>boolint</tt></a> on (this
makes bool and int indistinguishable types), 
sets <a href="appC.html#flag-modifies"><tt>modifies</tt></a> off (this prevents reporting of modification errors), and sets 
<a href="guide.html#flag-showfunc"><tt>showfunc</tt></a> to its original
setting (this controls  whether or not the name of a function is
displayed before a message).
