LCLint is a tool for statically checking C programs.  With minimal effort,
LCLint can be used as a better lint.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn1">[1]</a>  If
additional effort is invested adding annotations to programs, LCLint can
perform stronger checks than can be done by any standard lint.<p>
<p>
Some problems detected by LCLint include:<p>
<ul>
<li>	Violations of information hiding.  A user-defined type can be declared
as <i>abstract</i>, and a message is reported where code inappropriately
depends on the representation of the type.  (<a href="sec3.html">Section 3</a>) <p>
<li>	Inconsistent modification of caller-visible state.  Functions can be
annotated with information on what caller-visible state may be modified by the
function, and an error is reported if the modifications produced by the
function contradict its declaration.  (<a href="sec4.html#sec-4.1">Section 4.1</a>)<p>
<li>	Inconsistent use of global variables.  Information on what global and
file scope variables a function may use can be added to function declarations,
and a message is reported if the implementation of the function uses other
global variables or does not uses every global variable listed in its
declaration.  (<a href="sec4.html#sec-4.2">Section 4.2</a>)<p>
<li>	Memory management errors.  Instances where storage that has been
deallocated is used, or where storage is not deallocated (memory leaks).
(<a href="sec5.html#sec-5">Section 5</a>)<p>
<li>	Dangerous data sharing or unexpected aliasing.  Parameters to a function
share storage in a way that may lead to undefined or undesired behavior, or a
reference to storage within the representation of an abstract type is created.
(<a href="sec6.html#sec-6">Section 6</a>)<p>
<li>	Using possibly undefined storage or returning storage that is not
completely defined (except as documented).  (<a href="sec7.html#sec-7.1">Section 7.1</a>)<p>
<li>	Dereferencing a possibly null pointer.  (<a href="sec7.html#sec-7.2">Section 7.2</a>)<p>
<li>	Dangerous macro implementations or invocations. (<a href="sec8.html#sec-8">Section 8</a>)<p>
<li>	Violations of customizable naming conventions. (<a href="sec9.html#sec-9">Section 9</a>)<p>
<li>	Program behavior that is undefined because it depends on order of
evaluation, likely infinite loops, fall-through cases, incomplete logic,
statements with no effect, ignored return values, unused declarations, and
exceeding certain standard limits.  (<a href="sec10.html#sec-10">Section 10</a>)<p>
</ul>
<p>
LCLint checking can be customized to select what classes of errors are reported
using command line flags and stylized comments in the code.<p>
<p>

This document is a guide to using LCLint.  <a
href="sec1.html#sec-1">Section 1</a> is a brief overview of the design
goals of LCLint. <a href="sec2.html#sec-2">Section 2</a> explains how
to run LCLint, interpret messages produce, and control
checking. Sections <a href="sec3.html">3</a>-<a href="sec10.html">10</a> describe particular checks done by LCLint.

<h2>
1. Overview
</h2>

The main goals for LCLint are to:<p>
<ul>
<li>	Detect a large number of bugs in typical C programs, without producing
an unacceptable number of spurious messages.  We are willing to accept the
possibility that a few spurious messages are produced as long as it enables
significantly more powerful checking and the spurious messages can be
suppressed easily.<p>
<li>	Support a programming methodology involving abstract types and clean,
documented interfaces in standard C programs.<p>
<li>	Provide a gradual transition for programmers.  LCLint can be used like a
better standard lint with minimal effort.  Adding a few annotations to programs
enables significantly better checking.  As more effort is put into annotating
programs, better checking results. A representational effort/benefit curve for
using LCLint is shown in Figure 1 (not available in HTML format).  As
different checks are turned on and more information is given in code
annotations the number of bugs that can be detected increases dramatically. <p>
<li>	Provide enough flexibility so that LCLint can be used effectively with a
wide range of coding styles.  Especially important is making it easy to use
LCLint effectively to maintain and modify legacy code.<p>
<li>	Check programs quickly and with no user interaction.  LCLint
runs faster than most compilers.  Libraries can be used to enable fast
checking of a few modules in a large program.
</ul>
<p>

LCLint does many of the traditional lint checks including unused declarations,
type inconsistencies, use-before-definition, unreachable code, ignored return
values, execution paths with no return, likely infinite loops, and fall-through
cases.  This document focuses on more powerful checks that are made
possible by additional information given in source code annotations. <a
href="guide_fn.html#fn2">[2]</a>  Annotations are stylized comments that
document certain assumptions about functions, variables, parameters, and types.
They may be used to indicate where the representation of a user-defined type is
hidden, to limit where a global variable may be used or modified, to constrain
what a function implementation may do to its parameters, and to express checked
assumptions about variables, types, structure fields, function parameters, and
function results.  In addition to the checks specifically enabled by
annotations, many of the traditional lint checks are improved by exploiting
this additional information.
