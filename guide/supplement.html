This is a supplement to the LCLint User's Guide describing changes
between Version 2.0 and Version 2.1a.  These sections are also included
in the <a href="guide.html">LCLint User's Guide, Version 2.1a</a>.
<p>
<h2>Special Clauses</h2>
<p>

Sometimes it is necessary to specify function interfaces at a lower
level than is possible with the standard annotations.  For example, if a
function defines some fields of a returned structure but does not define
all the fields.  The <tt>/*@special@*/</tt> annotation is used to mark a
parameter, global variable, or return value that is described using
special clauses.  The usual implicit definition rules do not apply to a
special declaration.
<p>

Special clauses may be used to constrain the state of a parameter or
return value before or after a call.  One or more special clauses may
appear in a function declaration, before the modifies or globals
clauses.  Special clauses may be listed in any order, but the same
special clause should not be used more than once.  Parameters used in
special clauses must be annotated with <tt>/*@special@*/</tt> in the function
header.  In a special clause list, result is used to refer to the return
value of the function.  If result appears in a special clause, the
function return value must be annotated with <tt>/*@special@*/</tt>.
<p>

The following special clauses are used to describe the definition state
or parameters before and after the function is called and the return
value after the function returns:
<p>

<tt>/*@uses </tt><em>references</em><tt>@*/</tt> 
<blockquote>
References in the uses clause must be completely defined before the
function is called.  They are assumed to be defined at function entrance
when the function is checked.
</blockquote>

<tt>/*@sets </tt><em>references</em><tt>@*/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the sets clause must be allocated before the function is
called.  They are completely defined after the function returns. When
the function is checked, they are assumed to be allocated at function
entrance and an error is reported if there is a path on which they are
not defined before the function returns.
</blockquote>

<tt>/*@defines </tt><em>references</em><tt>@*/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the defines clause must not refer to unshared, allocated
storage before the function is called.  They are completely defined
after the function returns. When the function is checked, they are
assumed to be undefined at function entrance and an error is reported if
there is a path on which they are not defined before the function
returns.
</blockquote>

<tt>/*@allocates </tt><em>references</em><tt>@*/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the allocates clause must not refer to unshared, allocated
storage before the function is called.  They are allocated but not
necessarily defined after the function returns. When the function is
checked, they are assumed to be undefined at function entrance and an
error is reported if there is a path on which they are not allocated
before the function returns.
</blockquote>

<tt>/*@releases </tt><em>references</em><tt>@*/</tt>
<blockquote>
References in the releases clause are deallocated by the function.  They
must correspond to storage which could be passed as an only parameter
before the function is called, and are dead pointers after the function
returns.  When the function is checked, they are assumed to be allocated
at function entrance and an error is reported if they refer to live,
allocated storage at any return point.
</blockquote>
<p>

Additional generic special clauses can be used to describe other aspects
of the state of inner storage before or after a call.  Generic special
clauses have the form <em>state</em><tt>:</tt><em>constraint</em>.  The
state is either <tt>pre</tt> (before the function is called), or
<tt>post</tt> (after the function is called).  The constraint is similar
to an annotation.  The following constraints are supported:

<blockquote>
<h4>Aliasing Annotations</h4>

<tt>pre:only</tt>, <tt>post:only</tt><br>
<tt>pre:shared</tt>, <tt>post:shared</tt><br>
<tt>pre:owned</tt>, <tt>post:owned</tt><br>
<tt>pre:dependent</tt>, <tt>post:dependent</tt><br>
<blockquote>
References refer to <tt>only</tt>, <tt>shared</tt>, <tt>owned</tt> or
<tt>dependent</tt> storage before (<tt>pre</tt>) or after
(<tt>post</tt>) the call.
</blockquote>

<h4>Exposure Annotations</h4>

<tt>pre:observer</tt>, <tt>post:observer</tt><br>
<tt>pre:exposed</tt>, <tt>post:exposed</tt><br>
<blockquote>

References refer to <tt>observer</tt> or <tt>exposed</tt> storage before
(<tt>pre</tt>) or after (<tt>post</tt>) the call.

</blockquote>

<h4>Null State Annotations</h4>

<tt>pre:isnull</tt>, <tt>post:isnull</tt>
<blockquote>
References have the value <tt>NULL</tt> before (<tt>pre</tt>) or after
(<tt>post</tt>) the call. Note, this is not the same name or meaning as
the null annotation (which means the value may be <tt>NULL</tt>.)  
</blockquote>
<tt>pre:notnull</tt>, <tt>post:notnull</tt>
<blockquote>
References do not have the value <tt>NULL</tt> before (<tt>pre</tt>) or
after (<tt>post</tt>) the call. 
</blockquote>
</blockquote>

Some examples of special clauses are shown in <a
href="fig17.html">Figure 17</a>. The defines clause for
<tt>record_new</tt> indicates that the <tt>id</tt> field of the
structure pointed to by the result is defined, but the <tt>name</tt>
field is not.  So, <tt>record_create</tt> needs to call
<tt>record_setName</tt> to define the <tt>name</tt> field.  Similarly,
the releases clause for <tt>record_clearName</tt> indicates that no
storage is associated with the <tt>name</tt> field of its parameter
after the return, so no failure to deallocate storage message is
produced for the call to <tt>free</tt> in <tt>record_free</tt>.

<h2>Include Semantics</h2>

A major problem with LCLint 2.0 is handling system header files on
various platforms.  Since compilers are free to do whatever they want in
system header files, on many platforms these files contain
compiler-specific keywords and syntax that is not part of the C standard
and is not recognized by LCLint.  A few enhancements to LCLint 2.1a are
intended to alleviate these problems (eventually, the LCLint release
package should include a standardized set of annotated header files
instead of using the system header files).
<p>
The standard behavior of LCLint on encountering
<pre>
   #include &lt;X.h&gt;
</pre>

is to search for a file named <tt>X.h</tt> on the include search path (set using
<tt>-I</tt>) and then the system base include path (usually <tt>/usr/include</tt>, default
is set when LCLint is compiled).  The file <tt>X.h</tt> will be included
normally, unless <tt>X.h</tt> is the name of a standard library include file, <tt>X.h</tt>
is found in directory that is a system directory (as set by the
<tt>-systemdirs</tt> flag; the default is <tt>/usr/include</tt>), and
<tt>skipansiheaders</tt> is on (it is on by default).  To force all
headers to be included normally, use <tt>-skipansiheaders</tt>.

<p> Processing header files on gcc systems may require the
+gnuextensions flag.  This causes LCLint to support some of the gcc
extensions including <tt>__asm__</tt>, <tt>__attribute__</tt> and
alternate keywords.

<h2>Arbitrary Integral Types</h2>
<p>

In LCLint 2.0, the standard library types <tt>size_t</tt>,
<tt>ptr_diff</tt> and <tt>wchar_t</tt> were declared to have type
<tt>long unsigned</tt>.  In fact, the standard does not constrain their
types other than limiting them to integral types. In LCLint 2.1a, an
arbitrary integral type is used to represent these library types.  The
<tt>matchanyintegral</tt>, <tt>longintegral</tt>, and
<tt>longunsignedanyintegral</tt> flags control type checking for the arbitrary 
integral type.  If none of these flags is on, a type mismatch is
reported anywhere an arbitrary integral type is used where a specific
(possibly inconsistent) integral type is expected.
<p>
<h2>Flags</h2>

These flags are new for Version 2.1a.  For general information on flags,
see the <a href="appC.html">LCLint User's Guide</a>.

File Inclusion, Parsing
</h4>

<a href="appC.html#plain-key">plain</a>: <tt>+</tt><br>
<a name="flag-skipansiheaders">
<tt>skipansiheaders</tt>
<p>
Prevent inclusion of header files in a system directory with names that
match standard ANSI headers. The symbolic information in the standard library is used instead.
<p>

<a name="flag-systemdirexpandmacros">
<tt>systemdirexpandmacros</tt>

support duplicate qualifiers.

<p>
<a href="appC.html#plain-key">plain</a>: <tt>-</tt><br>
<a name="flag-gunextensions">
<tt>gnuextensions</tt>
