LCLint 2.2 --- 25 Aug 96

loop.c: (in function upto)
<A HREF="loop.c.html#line14" target="source">loop.c:14,10</A>: Suspected infinite loop.  No value used
    in loop test (x, glob1) is modified by test or
    loop body.
  This appears to be an infinite loop. Nothing in the
  body of the loop or the loop test modifies the value
  of the loop test. Perhaps the specification of a
  function called in the loop body is missing a
  modification. (-infloops will suppress message)
