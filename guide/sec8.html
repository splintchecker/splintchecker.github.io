8. Macros
</a></h2>
Macros are commonly used in C programs to implement constants or to mimic
functions without the overhead of a function call.  Macros that are used to
implement functions are a persistent source of bugs in C programs, since they
may not behave like the intended function when they are invoked with certain
parameters or used in certain syntactic contexts.  <p>
<p>
LCLint eliminates most of the potential problems by detecting macros with
dangerous implementations and dangerous macro invocations.  Whether or not a
macro definition is checked or expanded normally depends on flag settings and
control comments (see <a href="sec8.html#sec-8.3">Section 8.3</a>).  Stylized macros can also be used to define
control structures for iterating through many values (see <a href="sec8.html#sec-8.4">Section 8.4</a>).

Macros may be used to implement constants.  To get type-checking for constant
macros, use the  constant syntactic comment:
<pre>
/*@constant null char *mstring_undefined@*/
</pre>
Declared constants are not expanded and are checked according to the
declaration.  A constant with a null annotation may be used as only storage.

<a name="sec-8.2">8.2 Function-like Macros</a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
Using macros to imitate functions is notoriously dangerous.  Consider this
broken macro for squaring a number:<p>
<pre> 
   # define square(x) x * x
</pre>
This works fine for a simple invocation like square(i).  It behaves
unexpectedly, though, if it is invoked with a parameter that has a side
effect.<p>
<p>
For example, <tt>square(i++)</tt> expands to <tt>i++ * i++</tt>.  Not
only does this give the incorrect result, it has undefined behavior
since the order in which the operands are evaluated is not defined.  (See <a href="sec10.html#sec-10.1">Section 10.1</a> for more information
on how expressions exhibiting undefined evaluation order behavior are detected
by LCLint.)  To correct the problem we either need to rewrite the macro so that
its parameter is evaluated exactly once, or prevent clients from invoking the
macro with a parameter that has a side-effect.  <p>
<p>
Another possible problem with macros is that they may produce unexpected
results because of operator precedence rules.  The invocation, <tt>square(i+1)</tt>
expands to <tt>i+1*i+1</tt>, which evaluates to <tt>i+i+1</tt> instead
of the square of <tt>i+1</tt>.  To
ensure the expected behavior, the macro parameter should be enclosed in
parentheses where it is used in the macro body.<p>
<p>
Macros may also behave unexpectedly if they are not syntactically equivalent to
an expression.  Consider the macro definition,
<pre>
  # define incCounts()  ntotal++; ncurrent++;
</pre>
This works fine, unless it is used as a statement.  For example,
<pre>
if (x &lt; 3) incCounts();
</pre>
increments ntotal if <tt>x &lt; 3</tt> but always increments ncurrent.<p>
<p>
One solution is to use the comma operator to define the macro:
<pre>
  # define incCounts()  (ntotal++, ncurrent++)
</pre>
More complicated macros can be written using a do &#133; while construction:<p>
<pre>
  # define incCounts() \
     do { ntotal++; ncurrent++; } while (FALSE)
</pre>
LCLint detects these pitfalls in macro definitions, and checks that a macro
behaves as much like a function as possible.  A client should only be able to
tell that a function was implemented by a macro if it attempts to use the macro
as a pointer to a function.<p>
<p>
These checks are done by LCLint on a macro definition corresponding to a
function:<p>
<ul>
<li>	Each parameter to a macro (except those declared to be side-effect free,
see <a href="sec8.html#sec-8.2.1">Section 8.2.1</a>) must be used exactly once in all possible executions of the
macro, so  side-effecting arguments behave as expected.<a
href="guide_fn.html#fn21">[21]</a>  (Controlled by <a href="appC.html#flag-macroparams"><tt>macroparams</tt></a>.)
<li>	A parameter to a macro may not be used as the left hand side of an
assignment expression or as the operand of an increment or decrement operator
in the macro text, since this produces non-functional behavior.  (Controlled by
<a href="appC.html#flag-macroassign"><tt>macroassign</tt></a>.)
<li>	Macro parameters must be enclosed in parentheses when they are used in
potentially dangerous contexts.  (Controlled by <a href="appC.html#flag-macroparens"><tt>macroparens</tt></a>.)
<li>	A macro definition must be syntactically equivalent to a statement when
it is invoked followed by a semicolon. (Controlled by <a href="appC.html#flag-macrostmt"><tt>macrostmt</tt></a>.)
<li>	The type of the macro body must match the return type of the
corresponding function.  If the macro is declared with type void, its body may
have any type but the macro value may not be used.
<li>	All variables declared in the body of a macro definition must be in the
macro variable namespace, so they do not conflict with variables in the scope
where the macro is invoked (which may be used in the macro parameters).  By
default, the macro namespace is all names prefixed by m_.  (See <a href="sec9.html#sec-9.2">Section 9.2</a> for
information on controlling namespaces.)
</ul>       
At the call site, a macro is checked like any other function call.

<a name="sec-8.2.1">8.2.1 Side-Effect Free Parameters</A></a></a></a>
</a></h4>
Suppose we really do want to implement square as a macro, but want do so in a
safe way.  One way to do this is to require that it is never invoked with a
parameter that has a side-effect.  LCLint will check that this constraint
holds, if the parameter is annotated to be <i>side-effect free</i>.  That is,
the expression corresponding to this parameter must not modify any state, so it
does not matter how many times it is evaluated.  The sef annotation is used to
denote a parameter that may not have any side-effects:
<pre>
   extern int square (/*@sef@*/ int x);
   # define square(x) ((x) *(x))
</pre>
Now, LCLint will not report an error checking the definition of square even
though x is used more than once.<p>
<p>
A message will be reported, however, if square is invoked with a parameter that
has a side-effect.<p>
For the code fragment,
<pre>
square (i++)
</pre>
LCLint produces the message:
<pre>
   Parameter 1 to square is declared sef, but the argument may modify i: i++
</pre>
It is also an error to pass a non-sef macro parameter as a sef macro parameter
in the body of a macro definition.  For example,
<pre>
   extern int sumsquares (int x, int y);
   # define sumsquares(x,y) (square(x) + square(y))
</pre>
Although x only appears once in the definition of sumsquares it will be
evaluated twice since square is expanded. LCLint reports an error when a
non-sef macro parameter is passed as a sef parameter.<p>
<p>
A parameter may be passed as a sef parameter without an error being reported,
if LCLint can determine that evaluating the parameter has no side-effects.  For
function calls, the modifies clause is used to determine if a side-effect is
possible.<a href="guide_fn.html#fn22">[22]</a>   To prevent many spurious
errors, if the called function has no modifies clause, LCLint will report an
error only if sefuncon is on.  Justifiably paranoid programmers will insist on
setting sefuncon on, and will add modifies clauses to unconstrained functions
that are used in sef macro arguments.

<a name="RTFToC59">
<a name="sec-8.2.2">8.2.2 Polymorphism</A></a></a></a>
</a></h4>
One problem with our new definition of square is that while the original macro
would work for parameters of any numeric type, LCLint will now report an error
is the new version is used with a non-integer parameter.<p>
<p>
We can use the <tt>/*@alt </tt><em>type</em><tt>;,</tt>+<tt>@&#42;&gt;</tt>
syntax to indicate that an alternate type may be used.  For example,
<pre>
  extern int /*@alt float@*/ square (/*@sef@*/ int /*@alt float@*/ x);
  # define square(x) ((x) *(x))
</pre>
declares square for both ints and floats. <p>
Alternate types are also useful for declaring functions for which the return
value may be safely ignored (see <a href="sec10.html#sec-10.3.2">Section 10.3.2</a>).

<a name="RTFToC60">
<a name="sec-8.3">8.3 Controlling Macro Checking</A></a></a>
</a></h2>
By default, LCLint expands macros normally and checks the resulting code after
macros have been expanded.  Flags and control comments may be used to control
which macros are expanded and which are checked as functions or constants.<p>
<p>
If  the fcnmacros flag is on, LCLint assumes all macros defined with parameter
lists implement functions and checks them accordingly.  Parameterized macros
are not expanded and are checked as functions with unknown result and parameter
types (or using the types in the prototype, if one is given).  The analogous
flag for macros that define constants is constmacros.  If it is on, macros with
no parameter lists are assumed to be constants, and checked accordingly.  The
allmacros flag sets both fcnmacros and constmacros.  If the macrofcndecl flag
is set, a message reports parameterized macros with no corresponding function
prototype.  If the macroconstdecl flag is set, a similar message reports macros
with no parameters with no corresponding constant declaration.<p>
<p>
The macro checks described in the previous sections make sense only for macros
that are intended to replace functions or constants.  When fcnmacros or
constmacros is on, more general macros need to be marked so they will not be
checked as functions or constants, and will be expanded normally.  Macros which
are not meant to behave like functions should be preceded by the
<tt>/*@notfunction@*/</tt> comment.  For example,
<pre>
   /*@notfunction@*/
   # define forever for(;;)
</pre>
Macros preceded by notfunction are expanded normally before regular checking is
done.  If a macro that is not syntactically equivalent to a statement without a
semi-colon (e.g., a macro which enters a new scope) is not preceded by
notfunction, parse errors may result when fcnmacros or constmacros is on.

<a name="sec-8.4">8.4 Iterators</A></a></a></a></a></a>
</a></h2>
It is often useful to be able to execute the same code for many different
values.  For example, we may want to sum all elements in an intSet that
represents a set of integers.  If intSet is an abstract type, there is no easy
way of doing this in a client module without depending on the concrete
representation of the type.  Instead, we could provide such a mechanism as part
of the type's implementation.  We call a mechanism for looping through many
values an <i>iterator</i>.<p>
 <p>
The C language provides no mechanism for creating user-defined iterators.
LCLint supports a stylized form of iterators declared using syntactic comments
and defined using macros.<p>
<p>
Iterator declarations are similar to function declarations except instead of
returning a value, they assign values to their yield parameters in each
iteration.  For example, we could add this iterator declaration to
<tt>intSet.h</tt>:
<pre>
/*@iter intSet_elements (intSet s, yield int el);@*/
</pre>
The yield annotation means that the variable passed as the second actual
argument is declared as a local variable of type int and assigned a value in
each loop iteration.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC62">Defining
Iterators
</a></h4>
An iterator is defined using a macro.  Here's one (not particularly efficient)
way of defining intSet_elements:
<pre>
   typedef /*@abstract@*/ struct {
      int nelements;
      int *elements;
   } intSet;
   ...
   # define intSet_elements(s,m_el) \
     { int m_i; \ 
       for (m_i = (0); m_i &lt;= ((s)-&gt;nelements); m_i++) { \
           int m_el = (s)-&gt;elements[(m_i)];

   # define end_intSet_elements }}
</pre>
Each time through the loop, the yield parameter m_el is assigned to the next
value.  After all values have been assigned to m_el for one iteration, the loop
terminates.  Variables declared by the iterator macro (including the yield
parameter) are preceded by the macro variable namespace prefix m_ (see Section
8.2) to avoid conflicts with variables defined in the scope where the iterator
is used.
<h4>
<a name="RTFToC63">Using
Iterators
</a></h4>
The general structure for using an iterator is,<p>
<i>iter</i> (<i>&lt;params&gt;</i>) stmt; end_<i>iter</i><p>
For example, a client could use intSet_elements to sum the elements of an
intSet:
<pre>
   intSet s;
   int sum = 0;
   ...
   intSet_elements (s, el) { 
      sum += el; 
   } end_intSet_elements;
</pre>
The actual parameter corresponding to a yield parameter, el, is not declared in
the function scope.  Instead, it is declared by the iterator and assigned to an
appropriate value for each iteration.<p>
<p>
LCLint will do the following checks for uses of stylized iterators:<p>
<ul>
<li>	An invocation of the iterator <i>iter</i> must be balanced by a
corresponding end, named end_<i>iter</i>.
<li>	All actual parameters must be defined, except those corresponding to
yield parameters.
<li>	Yield parameters must be new identifiers, not declared in the current
scope or any enclosing scope.
</ul>
Iterators are a bit awkward to implement, but they enable compact, easily
understood client code.  For abstract collection types, an iterator can be used
to enable clients to operate on elements of the collection without breaking
data abstraction.
