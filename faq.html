        <p><a id="quest1" name="quest1">What is the difference between Splint and
        LCLint?</a></p>
<blockquote>

Before 2002, Splint was known as LCLint.  LCLint Version 3.0 was renamed
Splint Verion 3.0.  
<p>

LCLint was originally named for <b>LCL</b>, the Larch C Interface
Language and lint, a well-known C program checking tool.  Because our
tool has diverged from LCL, and our focus now is on secure programming,
it was renamed Splint.

Thomas Jefferson's <a

Walls</a> at the University of Virginia.  The walls are one brick thick,
but because of their design are both strong and aesthetic.  Like a
secure program, secure walls depend on sturdy bricks, solid

to fix broken bones.  It is also acceptable (but harder) to pronounce
it as "S" "P" "lint".

        <blockquote>

	Splint is independent from your compiler.  It checks standard C
	code, according to the ISO C99 specification.  Splint supports
	most, but not all, of the C99 extensions to the ANSI C.  Splint
	supports some of the gcc compiler extensions (if +gnuextensions
	is used).

          No, Splint does not check C++ code.  We don't have the
        resources (or the research justification) to build a C++

          For Win32, Splint looks for <tt>splint.rc</tt> instead of

        <blockquote>
          One possibility is that the installation directory where the test suite is
          running is on the system path (hence, splint won't report errors if
          <tt>-sysdirerrors</tt> is set, as it is by default). Try adding <tt>+sysdirerrors</tt> to the
          command line for the test suite to see if that is the problem, or installing
          Splint in a different directory not in the system path.<br></br>

        <p><a id="quest15" name="quest15">Why am I getting parse errors in

        <blockquote>
	Parse errors usually occur in code written for compilers that
	use nonstandard keywords or type names. (See the <a
	href="#quest14">question</a> on providing definitions of these names.)<br></br>

	If you're getting parse errors make sure that the required libraries are included by using the +posixlib or +unixlib flags.  If you're using nonstandard gnu extensions the +gnuextensions flag make be helpful.<br></br>

       However, Splint doesn't yet support all C99 extensions so there are some legitimate C programs that will need to be modified.<br></br>

      <li>
        <p><a id="quest16" name="quest16">Is every Splint warning a real
        error?</a></p>
        <blockquote>

          No.  Many of the program properties that Splint checks are
undecidable.  This means that any static analysis tool that can be run
on real programs will either produce false positives or false
negatives. Because of this and to improve efficiency, Splint makes some
simplifying assumptions.  This means that Splint will occasionally
produce spurious warnings or miss real errors.<br></br>

However, often spurious errors can be fixed by adding additional annotations.<br></br>

          Splint doesn't interpret const (at all). See the manual section on modifies
          checking (<a
          href="http://www.splint.org/manual/html/sec7.html">http://www.splint.org/manual/html/sec7.html</a>).<br></br>

        <blockquote>
          <p>You can often use -D to solve this problem.</p>
          <p>If you just want to ignore a keyword, you can add -Dnonstandardkeyword= to
          make the preprocessor eliminate the keyword, where nonstandardkeyword is the

        effectively?</a></p> <blockquote> 

The semantics of <tt>realloc</tt> cannot be describe precisely with
        Splint's annotations since its memory behavior is different
        depending on its return value.  When <tt>realloc</tt> succeeds, the
        pointer passed to it is no longer valid.&nbsp; The returned
        pointer points to available storage with the specified size, and
        the values are copied from the leading portion of the original
        storage indicated by the pointer passed to the function.&nbsp;
        When <tt>realloc</tt> returns a NULL pointer, and more than zero bytes
        were supposed to be allocated, no new storage has been
        allocated.&nbsp; The original pointer passed in is not
        deallocated and its contents are still accessible.&nbsp; (Under
        ANSI C '89 and later, malloc and <tt>realloc</tt> may return NULL if
        asked for zero bytes.&nbsp; In this case, <tt>realloc</tt> would release
        the old storage.)</p>

          <p>
	  If you do use <tt>realloc</tt>, we recommend that you use a
          wrapper around it.

        <blockquote>
          There are lots of things that the C spec allows and defines clearly, that
          Splint will provide warnings for. It's not a question of it being "wrong", it's
          a matter of it being likely to reveal a programming mistake.

        <blockquote>
          This is just a strategic decision --- we view ignoring the result of a <tt>scanf</tt> to
          be more likely to reveal a problem with the code than ignoring the result of a
          <tt>printf</tt>, even though strict programmers will want to check the result of <tt>printf</tt> also.
